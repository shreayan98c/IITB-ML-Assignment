      okay okay okay. we know that even if i dont eat, if i dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? i think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when i took the last meds, so i will need to talk to the doc about that. i took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm.

      so taking meds now to abate dinner, but i think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?  last night however, i took them rather late, because i ate rather late.  i will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we'll see what happens in the am. but even if i get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me.    ps, i ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.   bleh.  anyway, still way less carbs than normal

      not too good. lets see, i took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10. i did not eat lunch, but i had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 3\4 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.   total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after i took my last meds.   conclusion:   - meds are fast acting, i should eat right after i take them.   - i shouldn't eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.   however - i haven't eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.   also, yesterday i woke feeling light and airy. today i feel heavy. 40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than i normally eat in a day and i took all three glucophage and both glipizid. i really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.

      well of course the blogging honeymoon is over.   also i need to get a new domain, got paid today, will do this weekend. create several blog in blogs, with carb and blood counters. yahoootie!  been up and down and losing no weight with this puppy, really just trying to keep blood down. i feel its a good investment, because i will be living like this when i lose the weight. my only concern is the low carb mania. when it ends, will ben and jerry's still have low carb ice cream? miltons low carb bread? hay yi yi. i hope so, or life will be dismal indeed. diet cherry coke will save this summer for me. i feel a little  tingly and week. didnt have dinner until about ten last night. stirfry, veggies and chicken and diet soda and a glipizid. i hadnt had any meds since noon and i think my blood was high before dinner because at midnight it was 121. not horrible but would rather it was down to under 100. oh well.. im still in a good place. viva la raza!
