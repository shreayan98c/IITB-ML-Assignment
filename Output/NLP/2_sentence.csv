       the history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.   seitan (say-tahn) is made from gluten. gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. known as seitan in japan, as kofu in china, and as ""wheat meat"" and ""gluten"" here in the u.s., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. it has been eaten in china, japan, korea, russia and the middle east for thousands of years. gluten is often referred to in chinese restaurants as ""buddha food"", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian buddhist monks as a meat substitute. it is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.   as a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of b vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. a 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. the same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. as recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.   another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). if you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.   many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at chinese or vietnamese restaurants, where it's called ""mock duck"", ""mock chicken"", etc. when it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word ""gluten"" lacks consumer appeal. it stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too ""meaty."" however, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, wheat meat"" is growing in popularity.   seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. the dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. what is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. when raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called ""seitan"".   it is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. it can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. each version yields a different texture. oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well.    - written by alyx sandborg, copyright 2002 by pagewise, inc

      westwood has  lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes  and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urllink quorn ) for two years. after ending three years in the wilderness since his heady 2000 with two wins last year, westwood, lying 64th in europe and with only moderate performances on the u.s. tour, is aiming to prove he really is back.  'i saw the benefits darren was getting and i've felt like i needed to do something for a long time,' said clarke's management stablemate. 'the great thing is, i've lost all this weight and on the (reuters) statistics i'm (driving) 10-15 yards longer.'

      hosted by kim o'donnel washingtonpost.com staff writer thursday, april 29, 2004; 12:00 pm  released may 5, 2004  a graduate of peter kump's new york cooking school, kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.   the transcript follows.   editor's note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over live online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   kim o'donnel: hello out there. it's been a while since our last get-together. for those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last thursday on the month. since we last discussed, i came across a fun piece on yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: ""flexatarian."" i think that would aptly describe my eating habits. interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. so, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. onward...   _______________________   i'm a goin veggie huntin....: kim!; two questions: first, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? second, what great things should i look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?    kim o'donnel: the nice people at arlington courthouse have been very patient with me as i've not gotten my act together on setting a date. it'll be sometime in may or june, probably june. funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on wtop this morning was all about my finds last weekend. think green, kids. it's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!   _______________________   frederick, md.: i'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. however, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (my goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)   kim o'donnel: there is a vegetarian cooking school in new york city that has a good reputation. name escapes me at the moment; it might be natural cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. check out shawguides.com   _______________________   st. paul, minn.: my two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. i don't think he gets enough calcium. any suggestions? and can you tell me how to make a smoothie? after i make one, how long can i leave it in the refrigerator?   kim o'donnel: lentils are loaded with calcium. spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: i prefer with yogurt, and to it, i add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. i don't add ice or juice because i like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim. just got back from new orleans and while i made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, i'd love to make my own. any suggestions? i'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?   kim o'donnel: i think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the gimme lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!   _______________________   prince frederick, md.: can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of sherpas in tibet. most of what i've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. i want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. i still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.   i can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. but what really turned me off about meat was reading ""fast food nation."" it revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. i recommend everyone read it, as well as ""the jungle"" by upton sinclair.   kim o'donnel: prince,  vegetarian cookbooks have come a long way from the days of co-ops and communes...there are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. immediately what comes to mind are titles by deborah madison, jeanne lemlin and then there's crescent dragonwagon's ""passionate vegetarian"", loads of titles by robin robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim,   my husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. any ideas as to what it is?  thanks a bunch!   kim o'donnel: the green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. this is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. you can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, really well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   virginia: does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? i am looking for big pieces, not something that is ""ground."" i have tried a couple of things without much luck. thanks!   kim o'donnel: many looking for similar products like the taste of quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?   _______________________   anonymous: i have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. they sell it at whole foods.   kim o'donnel: thanks for chiming in...that's what i was thinking...   _______________________   silver spring, md.: for meatless jambalaya, i'd use tempeh, i like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. some seitan might be good for texture also.   kim o'donnel: ah, bueno. thanks, silver!   _______________________   reston, va.: i'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but i hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)?   kim o'donnel: yes, yes, yes!  arlington courthouse, on saturday mornings.  dupont circle and takoma park, sunday mornings.    _______________________   veggie burger: i've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? not lentils, please (ewww...)   kim o'donnel: a few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. since then, i made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. i did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but i gotta get you the details. i don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after i look through my papers at home...   _______________________   arlington, va.: we like to eat morning star farms ""chik nuggets"" - they also come in patties. my son particularly likes to have this when friends who ""hate"" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something not chicken.   kim o'donnel: thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, arlington.   _______________________   east falls church, va.: hi, kim!   you mentioned last chat (tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. i presume you peel it first, but i, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).   thanks!   kim o'donnel: hey efc,  yeah, i cut off what i need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m&p. works really well, and no, you do get what you need.   _______________________   dupont circle, washington, d.c.: for your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it's called the natural  gourmet cookery school  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in new york city.  they also do dinners open to the public on most  friday evenings. sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.   kim o'donnel: hey, thanks for following up!   _______________________   new york, n.y.: kim,   i need fruit help. i feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? what should i look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? i'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when i all really want is to stop at kripsy kreme!;   thanks!;   kim o'donnel: it is a tough time for fruit. i was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   re: low fat veggie cookbook: moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes many more things than what sherpas would eat. it has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.   kim o'donnel: thanks for reminding me...my moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.   _______________________   for reston looking for farmers market in nova:: the falls church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   kim o'donnel: great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.   _______________________   alexandria, va.: hi kim!   when you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the alexandria farmers' market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. it's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every saturday.   kim o'donnel: very glad that you've reminded me, alexandria.   _______________________   virginia: i am so excited, i just have to share. for years, i have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in indian restaurants, but the ones i made were never as good. i finally found the secret: rosewater. you only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. also, the frozen mango chunks from trader joe's make lassi-making very easy, and i find the quality to be very good. i have been drinking them every day this week!   kim o'donnel: funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.   _______________________   silver spring, md.: hi kim -  i have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... i've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.   i'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. do you have any ideas?   love your chats - you rock!   kim o'donnel: squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, silver. some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. sounds nice.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim, i want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? would i cook the tofu at all before adding it in? i'm not sure where to start...   thanks!!   kim o'donnel: do you want to do coconut milk curry? talk to me.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim,  white bean bruschetta - i tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients - & i  bought the wrong kind of beans. here's  what i came up with so far - what am i  missing (or how can i vary it)?   tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   kim o'donnel: the beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in italy, bruschetta are among the many ""salatini"" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. you can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. lemon zest is great. rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   fairfax, va: kim,   my wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and i'm a happy meat eater. i'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but i'd like to do it on the grill. what can i cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (and how do i do it)?   thanks!;   kim o'donnel: you can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. serve over rice. you, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim,  speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on thursdays in penn quarter (i think it was on 7th and e maybe?) is it coming back? do you know when? it was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  thanks!   kim o'donnel: yes, it is. starting next thursday, may 6, from 3 to 7.   _______________________   bethesda, md.: hello-  do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? preferably in md. thanks   kim o'donnel: weekend section usually does an annual list which i'm betting will come out next month. anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?   _______________________   rockville, md.: my favorite italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. in making this at home would you recommend the ""plain old salted"" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   kim o'donnel: plain, unsalted. you got it...   _______________________   vegetarian pigs in a blanket: does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? i am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. thanks!;   kim o'donnel: i'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hey kim, a quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? i'm trying to cut back on sugar, so i'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. thanks   kim o'donnel: making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?: any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? there's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the march cooking light that i'd like to modify. thanks   kim o'donnel: chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. i don't know for sure. my copy of ""dairy-free cooking"" offers some ""cream sauce"" ideas...so why not??   _______________________   vege in fairfax, va.: to the question about paneer from the what's cooking chat. one can drain it in cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. keep in a cold place overnite. remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  actually mango lassi is not very common in india. lassi is usually salty. i just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. yummy  try cardamon in your mango lassi for the extra zing!   kim o'donnel: thanks, fairfax...great tidbits...i'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   st. louis, mo.: another cookbook suggestion: i started out veggie with the ""horn of the moon"" cookbook by ginny callan. many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. a follow-up book, ""beyond the moon,"" includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) worth a look.   kim o'donnel: not familiar with this one, st. lou. thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   suitland, md.: does anyone know of a good soy cheese brand? something that actually tastes like cheese? i am looking for a block that i can grate.   thanks!!   kim o'donnel: who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim!; i have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. i have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. i was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? thanks!;   kim o'donnel: blanching them does help bring them along, washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   bethesda, md.: hello kim-  i have an eggplant question for you. i generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that i really, really love it. i know it is simple but can't figure it out. i usually have it as antipasto in italian restaurants or when i was in italy. it is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. i don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. can you help me? thanks   kim o'donnel: eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, bethesda. was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? do tell...   _______________________   boston, mass.: hi kim,   what can i do with broccoli besides steam it?  thanks!   kim o'donnel: i like roasting it, at 500 degrees. but first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. it's a great treat!   _______________________   indian head, md.: hi kim! my new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. i am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.   they are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!   j   kim o'donnel: let's see...i'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: my special someone has a birthday coming up and i wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that i could try and use?   kim o'donnel: spectacular and vegetarian...i'm thinking of a curry. i've got an interesting idea for a thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but i think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   oxford, miss: i'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but i'm getting bored with my recipe. do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?   kim o'donnel: do you make a sofrito for your r& b? you know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...i'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   reston, va.: good morning kim. still struggling with the white sweet potatos. any ideas?

i.e. does the can say ""white beans"" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? thanks for the insight.   kim o'donnel: white beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and great northern beans. they are interchangeable.   _______________________   adams morgan: how does one make a white bean spread?   kim o'donnel: a can of drained white beans. whiz in a food processor. olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. taste. lemon zest is nice, too. taste. add more seasoning if needed. taste for smoothness, too. you're good to go.   _______________________   arlington, va: hi,   i hope you can help me. i have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. the only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if i grind up veggies inside dumplings. i tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in fear factor eating worms. i think it's a texture thing. do you have any suggestions?   kim o'donnel: take her to the farm market this weekend. introduce her to a farmer. let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. let me know how it goes...   _______________________   kim o'donnel: out of time, folks. thanks for all the good stuff. take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! the air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! promise to be back for end of may, and in meatime, join me for the regular tuesday free for all..best to you.   _______________________    â© 2004 washingtonpost.newsweek interactive

      by jessica rae patton, may 7 2004  i recently spent the weekend in chicago, the city of encased meat. just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.  at hot doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.  but there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. because the fact is, although i'm a vegan, i'm a fool for fake meat. or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside french fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. these food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. but i guess because chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as studs terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. i, for one, thank doug and his colleagues for this. that was one damn good dog. char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.  i returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that i might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. i dragged my boyfriend, art, along to taste-test the real ones.  i f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. at the original swanky frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic i-95 on-ramp, the owner, bob, snorted, ""that would be sacrilegious.""  ""but i was in chicago, and--""  ""this isn't chicago, is it?"" he said and walked away. was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? maybe i was naã¯ve to the subversive nature of soy protein. and here i just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.  i sat on a rickety stool and ordered french fries and blathered on about writing a food review. the fry cook, who looked like billy bob thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is french fries. these guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.  in all fairness, our server at the swankier of the swankies, in westport, was super-friendly. (let's consider the first location skanky frank's, as to not confuse the two.) she smiled and everything. the place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory. art highly approved of the deep-fried technique. ""it makes the texture crackly, not snappy.""  ""snappy?""  ""yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. the skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps.""  he also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. for the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. ""the bacon's under the dog, where it should be,"" he noted.  the french fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. we liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.  dog: $2.90, fries: $2.25   â€¢ â€¢ â€¢    rawley's drive-in 1886 post rd., fairfield, 259-9023  rawleys' dã©cor makes skanky frank's look positively posh. the wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.

""i am sorry i am not what you need,"" you assured me as you let me go.  you never knew that all i asked of you was to keep holding me just a little longer, but knowing that was not worth the asking.  written 8/4/03 4:25am

						    from flames   if there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.  i have reached to the stars, i have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.  i dusted them off  and shined them up, as though god cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.  what's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.  i followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until i realized it was only  a representation.  i gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.  still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.  still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.  and night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.  flap, flap, flap.

						    a step closer to stepping off   voices raised like hands above heads, like waves  of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting  an end or just wanting  more.  the world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud  or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business.  drums beat to  mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more  than  a barrier breached again  and again.  for whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences?  for whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge?  wrong, wrong, wrong but will  we know right  when we see it?  bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it?  the opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home.  the shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.

       current phase: full moon in gemini  begins thursday 2:11 pm est / ends: monday 7:19 am est  the full moon is the time when the moon reflects the greatest amount of the sun's light. the earth is astronomically poised between the sun and the moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the gemini energy is adept at spotting. the opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the sun and the moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. the polarity of gemini is sagittarius.the polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. since we are in the sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced.  by providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the full moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. this opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the full moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. there's literally an electrical energy build-up before a full moon and a release just after the peak. at the full moon, the seeds sown at the last new moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown. working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering.    about gemini (ruler mercury):   the astrological symbol of gemini is the twins. like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless.  within the zodiac, gemini is opposite sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. while sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail.  the element of gemini is air. air is vital to human survival. without air, we would perish. air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. it’s the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. the three air signs are gemini, libra, and aquarius. in astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. the quality of gemini is mutable. the four mutable signs gemini, virgo, sagittarius, and pisces. in astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility.   gemini - full moon meditation   from  urllink the labours of hercules    «i recognize my other self and while this fades i grow and glow.» (may 21 - june 20)  this full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of hercules from the greek myth. the twelve tasks of hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the heart of god. as mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. so we travel ""on the path until we become that path"", from aries to taurus and gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to pisces. in gemini active work sets the standard tone. first comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in aries and overcome desire in taurus - the light of god everywhere.  in the third sign of the astrological year, gemini, the twins, hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the hesperides. unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. perseverance holds the key.  the task appears to be easy and hercules hurries into it. but the garden of the hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. throughout the land hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. he is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. from north he turns to south and wrestles with antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. antaeus overcomes him at every point until hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. to the west hercules now turns with new courage. he meets busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. hercules loves and adores busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. finally hercules turns inwards and realises that ""truth lies within yourself"". so he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. a pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of hercules, the one of prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. hercules breaks the binding chain, frees prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. with much loss of time hercules turns to the high mountains of the east, meeting atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. he forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. so he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. but lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise atlas. from the loving hands of atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. three sisters - aegle, erythea and hesperis - await him with more apples declaring ""the way to us is always marked by service. deed of love are signposts on the way"". the story ends with hercules returning the apples to the three sisters ""for those who follow"".  the sign of gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: one pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. they symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher self (atma-buddhi-manas). the pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. five tests hercules has to pass before the fruits of wisdom become his own: sincerity, alertness, persistence, the unfolding of power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving service for others.  in gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the higher self. in the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry ""the weight of the world"". both, prometheus and atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher self. loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. the keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher self which will then grow and glow.   sources:   urllink artcharts    urllink http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/tidepool/4036/gemini.html    urllink the labours of hercules

       current phase: full moon in leo   sunday 3:52pm pst until wednesday 11:26 pm pst when it moves into libra   leo has a real sense of specialness and perceives all it creates as gifts bestowed upon the rest of us in the name of love and life. anything can happen under the influence of this most romantic of moons. leo loves to be the center of attention, so get out there and shine! for those of you who made commitments to life changes on the new moon in aquarius, this is the time to put those plans into action. you get to begin your new life with the self-confidence of a leo full moon opposing uranus in aquarius, which represents the radical energy to throw out the old and bring in the new. the venus and chiron conjunction in capricorn will give you added strength to achieve your goals; no matter how hard and long it takes. remember that on a full moon, it helps to release your old behavior through ritual. this is a full moon of great inspiration and should not be wasted. if you have been suffering with creative blocks, the leo full moon bestows the energy to break free of inertia and get into action. if it doesn't, you might reconsider your project or direction. maybe it's just not the right one   this year the leo full moon will be directly opposite uranus in aquarius. some think that aquarius and leo are diametrically opposed to one another. but i find their synergistic and interdependent relationship unique among the signs. aquarius demands radical change, which cannot be accomplished without leo's talents: unwavering self-belief in one's personal vision and true leadership. leo demands creativity and caring, which requires the aquarian rejection of personal glorification in favor of global identification. when balanced, the leo/aquarius polarity works hand in hand to further the evolution of human civilization. corruption, greed and suffering only exist when these energies lack equilibrium.  the leo full moon assures us all that we have great personal power and we must learn to use it judiciously. this is the full moon to try on the role of leader. if you have wanted to come out front with your great ideas, this is the time to try. the connection with ego identity is strong on this full moon. leo understands how much power it can wield, and will never shy away from using this knowledge to accomplish even the most outrageous goals. forget the stereotypical leo: a partygoer dancing with a lampshade on their head. instead, think of showing up with a serious commitment to who you are and not backing down for anything. leo is total self-belief and it uses total commitment to gain success and glory. think of madonna (sun in leo); she is a powerful presence who insists upon owning her vision and maintaining total control of the product. as we say in silicon valley, ""it's all about believing your own marketing."" yes, of course there is a dark side to power and glory. we all know that an inflated ego creates the right conditions for abuses of power. but power used wisely can be of great benefit to all.   the beauty of leo is how much it truly cares about others, and since this is a full moon, let's get into a celebratory space and bask in the light of leo's positive qualities. this is the most dramatic, elegant and fun full moon of the year. so get out and enjoy the fireworks!    source:   urllink astrowisdom

       leo lunar cycle  july 28 - august 26 interpretation by maya del mar from  urllink http://www.daykeeperjournal.com   leo is about expressing our selfhood, our personal centers, the heart of ourselves, that natural order within us which comes from spirit, and the expression of which gives our lives joy and drama and meaning. leo is about integrity, nobility, honor, generosity, being true to the unfolding of ourselves and sharing that unfolding freely. in cancer we created our personal, safe spot, our home port, our power place. now in leo we can grow in the garden which we’ve created, and blossom there for all the world to see. leo is associated with flower gardens, which capture the sun not for utility but for beauty’s sake, simply to show off the splendors of life. on joyous and ceremonial occasions we give flowers, a symbol of sharing the divine love which we feel in our hearts.   leo is a time when we have the power to bring new life energy from our deepest humanitarian resources into expression in our character and daily activities. think of the sun, endlessly radiating heat and light to the solar system. now we can incorporate that great energy into our own centers. leo leads to growth in our creative talents by strengthening both mind and will. abstract thought is stimulated, as is power, confidence, and enthusiasm. our receptivity to subtle forces and the powers of the imagination are also increased.   self-mastery can take a giant leap during leo time, leading to a new appreciation of our capabilities and an enhanced feeling of identity. leo is also inspirational. vacationing, traveling, enjoying and celebrating the beauties of creation are leonian. the greatest expression of leo is love—the divine force which nurtures that which it has created. so now, during leo time, let the love flow—love of nature, love of ourselves, love of our fellow humans, and love of the omnipresent divine spark.  bill clinton is a very leo type. notice his lion’s mane, his commanding presence, and the magnetic radiance which beams from him. he has created his own life and forged his own destiny with a strong sense of purpose, and in the process has inspired people around him, all leo qualities. carl jung, with sun in leo, broke from freud and viewed the psyche as an evolving, growing center from which, like a mandala, life patterns radiate—an expression of the sun within ourselves. rosalynn carter and jacqueline onassis are examples of leo first ladies. they both illustrate the natural dignity of leo. pride and arrogance can be leo pitfalls.""

       urllink scorpio lunar cycle  by crystal pomeroy oct. 25 - nov. 22 this scorpio new moon begins the lunar cycle marked by samhain, halloween (originally, hallow’s mass), el día de los muertos, and all souls' day—the classic scorpio festivities around the world. prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start. it also gives us a chance to move into the year’s end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong saturn influences.  according to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of life’s most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. the current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .  according to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.  from these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. on special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by wikkans and central americans of native descent). at its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (mother earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.  the race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the samhain new moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing year’s goals . stay tuned to our meditation for the full moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our year’s work, as we will also share a magical full moon offering to heal mother earth.  before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, let’s reflect on what this particular samhain new moon has to do with tolerance. in the first place, wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by european churches. furthermore, the intense saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this new moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in cancer, emotional, judgment nature. metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within,  informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection.  tolerance is a personal and global necessity. as remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in nazi germany, the mccarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of muslims, and the recent special elections in california.  the following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, ""as above, so below."" if you are still reading this by now, chances are you’re among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. in such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather  staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. prayer for this intent can release us to the power of higher love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. this dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvest’s last fruits, are released unto mother earth.  call on the power of endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year!  1) make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003.  2) on another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals.  3) call on the angel of endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning:  i call on the power of endings which is now renewing the earth, to eliminate all that would delay the consolidation of my highest work. just as leaves now fall away and are dissolved into the earth, those situatons, activities, beliefs and behaviors that need to, now drop from the panorama of my life so that my highest endeavors may consolidate and prosper, quickly and in peace.

""as you believe, so it is done unto you."" it's time to reclaim your true power by reaffirming  the truth of who you really are.  utilize the powerfully expansive energies of this jupiter-ruled cycle and the ignition sparks provided by the new moon solar eclipse set up to complete the surrender into your true identity as higher greater self. then walk that truth as you move toward your highest goals. all things are possible, if you believe.

'self' is the inner essence, soul identity and authenticity of each individual.  when we are in alignment with self, we base our choices upon one's true values and personal integrity, and enjoy a certain level of completion, joy, flow, and wholeness.    as individuals come into a greater sense of self and spirit, they assist in raising the consciousness of the planet, as  well as themselves.   when our cup is full, we are available to assist others.  this lifetime offers a grand opportunity to live in a new level of awareness, authenticity and happiness.  we are the seedlings of the aquarian age, the forerunners plowing the way for greater souls of light to embody with us and take us to greatest party we have experienced in thousands of years, the golden age of aquarius.

       urllink pisces lunar cycle  by ronni lynn feb 20 - march 20  this month the new moon will be in the sign of pisces. pisces is a most mystical sign because it deals with the unconscious side of life and ourselves.  pisces' influence dissolves boundaries- those barriers that separate people and even nations from understanding each other.  when boundaries are lifted we experience compassion, true understanding and a gentleness toward ourselves and each other. in order to accomplish this we must first deal with dissolving those boundaries within ourselves. by this i mean the differences between our external selves (how we act, dress, what we say we believe, etc) with our internal selves- who we truly are. when we are free to reflect to the outside who we really are then we will experience increased authenticity. with this authenticity we will begin to experience true connections with others. after all, if we are being a true reflection of ourselves, it will be our truth that others will be responding to. what a wonderful foundation for any relationship! when people who are being true to themselves interact, when their internal, and/or subconscious self is reflected outwardly, barriers between them will melt because they will have an understanding of each other. we all have much more in common than we realise or would like to admit. with this in mind, this is a good time to forgive others who have wronged us, ask forgiveness, or to forgive ourselves for past failures.   a good way to find your inner truth is to quiet your mind, to meditate and just observe what comes up. sometimes defense mechanisms that may have served us at the time of a traumatic experience persist and only serve to block our true energies from arising. you can sometimes tell that this is happening when you no longer allow yourself to feel vulnerable emotionally with others. this is a time when as we relax our minds and bodies we learn to release those tensions that block our emotional response with others. pisces rules higher ideals, dreams and inspirations.  let your imagination and creativity expand during this time.  we can wish to increase our spiritual awareness, our surrender to and faith in a higher power, or to find the correct spiritual path or teacher. at this time perhaps we can come to a realization that everything has a purpose, we are all connected, and that there is a perfect order to the universe. we are all part of the unfolding of that universe. this is a good month to wish for a decrease in feeling like a victim, or in feeling helpless or out of control. these are pisces qualities that can go overboard. we need to  curb a tendency for complete escapism , such as overuse of alcohal or drug abuse. while fantasy and inspiration can work to help us develop into more evolved beings, to expand our possibilities, we can also  learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, truth from fiction . we must avoid the tendency to deceive ourselves and others with escapism. pisces energy helps us dream, and offers us the opportunity to use that dream to make the world a better place for everyone. neptune's energy can be harnessed to increase our creativity and creative expression in art, writing, dance, drama, or music.  dreams and inspiration are the first steps before action.    the next sign, aries will take the actions that follow the dreams that pisces created. pisces is the last sign of the zodiac and with the dreams of pisces feeding unconsciously into the energies of the first sign of the zodiac, aries, the cycle is again complete. the next new moon will be in aries on march 20, 2004 at 5:42 pm. e.s.t. come visit me then or a few days before for more new moon reflections.   with blessings- ronni

        urllink gemini lunar cycle : by rev. pauline southard  this month's lunar cycle has an overall scattered feeling especially after may 21, 2004 when the sun leaves taurus for light and mutable gemini. we feel we are jumping from one thing to another. taking even just a few minutes to regroup will truly help this month. the new moon of may 19, 2004 arrives at 12:51 am edt. this is the last gasp of the very fixed taurus energy we experienced during the last lunar cycle. this new moon lies at the very bottom of the chart, beckoning us to plant our spring gardens and attend to matters around the house. we could really use a little time out from work. a household crisis requires that we scramble to manipulate our schedules.  our committed love relationships are smooth sailing now. sexual intimacy provides us with a wonderful nurturing connection that lasts long after the physical act is completed. truly a meeting of souls.   this part of the lunar cycle provides us with great potential to plan our summer vacations and those of the children we are responsible for. a sibling conveys some good advice concerning matters of the heart and/or financial affairs.   the first quarter moon of may 27, 2004 at 3:56 am edt starts its work while we are still dreaming. the sun has now entered gemini. gemini energy in its pure form is all about communication, inquisitiveness and love of socializing. at its best, its clever wit can cause us to look at matters from a different perspective while laughing. when this energy is used negatively, it can denote lack of focus, the facile & easy answer over the deeper and more thoughtful approach and a disregard for other’s feelings.   expect some unexpected expenses that may impede our goals in the short term. however, towards the end of the first quarter moon, we find that our partners are particularly helpful in very practical and substantial ways.  the full moon of june 3, 2004 at 12:19 am edt makes everything appear larger than life as the sun and moon depart from a square to jupiter. relax! although we feel that we must do it all perfectly, perhaps an adequate job will suffice without totally stressing us out. any recent tensions in our relationships ease now. it could be fun to see a play or an unusual foreign movie now.  the third quarter moon of june 9, 2004 at 4:02 pm edt heightens our emotional sensitivity. we are particularly adept at tuning into our lover’s and children’s feelings. a great time to go to the beach and paint! or we could single mindedly pursue projects that have seemed to have had a missing element until now and complete them. it is a great week for a trip with a lover- either an inner or literal journey would be wonderful now.

        lunar energy: full moon rituals   the moon has always played an important part in ancient spiritual practices. since the beginning of time, people have recognized lunar power, which is where the term, ""lunacy"" comes from. even today there is much speculation as to the affects of the moon's phases, particularly the full moon, on our moods and behavior. the belief behind full moon rituals is to harness lunar power to the benefit of oneself and others. ceremonies performed at this phase of the moon are meant for empowerment, as well to manifest positive changes.   the full moon appears once every 29.53 days, therefore rituals can be performed almost every month, sometimes even twice a month. and, you need not be outside or even see the full moon to reap its powerful benefits. there are many full moon rituals, some more complex than others, involving magical tools and enhancements. yet, many are quite simple, including a moon bask which is just that, basking in the full moonlight and meditating. you can do the ritual standing, sitting, or laying on the ground, or even indoors if it's more practical. just stand by a large window, open if possible, and meditate on that which would enhance your life.   one well-known ceremony is ""drawing down the moon,"" to connect with the power and wisdom of the full moon. in wicca traditions, a priestess performs the ceremony in order for her to become the living embodiment of the mood goddess. there are also rituals where all participants ""draw down the moon"" to evoke the deity of the moon within themselves. for a healing ritual, selena fox, of the circle craft tradition, offers this moon mirror healing. place a silvered mirror face up on an altar or sacred place so that the light of the full moon shines upon it. place a symbol to represent the one seeking healing in the center of the mirror. the symbol may be a photo, piece of jewelry, lock of hair, or simply a name on a card. use the symbol on the mirror in the moonlight as a focal point as you imagine that the one needing healing is becoming well and then healthy. after the ritual, deliver the symbol to the subject of the healing rite as an additional way of transmitting healing. cleanse the mirror you used by washing it with a mugwort solution or passing it through the smoke from mugwort or another incense. in this way, the mirror will be ready for use for another healing.   whether you perform simple or elaborate full moon rituals, or just enjoy the beauty of the full moon, you're participating in a long tradition of showing appreciation for a powerful source of illumination.    for more information visit  urllink circlesanctuary.org     want more dailyom?  urllink sign up  for your free email, or check out the  urllink archives .

       urllink cancer lunar cycle  by maya del mar&nbsp; july 17 -&nbsp;august 16   during the passage of the sun through cancer we are  extraordinarily open to our inner selves , to our own depths, to our own connections with the universe. the vulnerability of this state increases our need for security, and we find ourselves attending to those aspects of our lives which center in our own hearth—our inner child, our family, our domestic lives, our homes, our businesses—those things which relate to creating a stable base, those situations in which we find  safety and comfort .   the sun enters the sign of cancer at summer solstice. this is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. at that moment the days begin to shorten, the night force takes over, and we begin our six-month journey of gradually embracing the darkness, which climaxes at winter solstice on december 21.   like the night to which she introduces us,  the forces of cancer are mysterious . they are ruled by the moon, the goddess of the night, who brings her waxing and waning lanterns to guide us through the dark, through the murky unconscious, through the watery depths of feeling.   in gemini we made connections with every passing event, as we restlessly kept ourselves in motion, learning about the world, exploring. now in cancer it is time to center ourselves, to  turn within  and learn who we are and what we need, to nurture our inner child and create a safe home for it. the darkness of the subconscious is our real staging ground for life, and we must develop lines of support to anchor ourselves to its vastness, while at the same time maintaining fluid passageways for growth, for change, and for movement to new levels.   in aries, we brought the seed of spirit to earth, in taurus we multiplied the seeds, in gemini the air swept them up to disperse them, and now in cancer each seed will  find its proper spot in which to put down strong roots .   it is most appropriate that we plant our gardens by the moon, which rules cancer. the moon fluctuates within its monthly cycle, and also is connected with the daily fluctuations of tidal waters throughout the world. underlying this fluctuation, which may seem capricious if we don’t pay attention to life’s rhythms, there are regular cycles and predictability. the energy of cancer, similarly, is a fluctuating movement—going within to deep sources and then moving out to express those depths in the world, ever shifting as do the ocean currents. but like the moon cancer has its inner predictability, and is accountable to its own rhythms.   cancer rules containers of all kinds, including the womb, where young life is nourished, and the home, where families are nourished. it rules gestation, that vulnerable time when an embryo is being formed deep within layers of protection.   cancer is associated with bodies of fluid, such as lakes and amniotic sacs. it knows. it knows that water, which symbolizes emotions in astrology, is the essential matrix of life, and that feelings are tender and vulnerable and must be protected, just as the growing fetus must be protected. it knows intimately about growth, because it carries the growth process within itself. and growth, too, must be protected and attended to so that the fledgling is strong and healthy. &nbsp; the sabian symbol for 26 cancer is:   ""guests are reading in the library of a luxurious home. the transference of social privilege to the level of intellectual enjoyment. we see the concretization of cultural excellence and wealth at the level at which individuals can exercise their developmental capacities in comfort. the process is individualized because the library belongs to a private residence, the luxury of which implies an individual’s concentration upon the acquisition of wealth. maintaining class standards of information. what is at stake here is the need to conform to the requirements of one’s social status."" &nbsp; &nbsp;

        bees invade the internet   by bbc news online internet reporter mark ward  soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet.   researchers at the university of california are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online.   michael wang and tatsuya suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate.   what is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology.   the researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants.   individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control.   by contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people.   mr wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our pcs to refrigerators is online.   no-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says.   ""the devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things,"" says mr wang.   many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.   when sir paul mccartney did a webcast of a performance at the cavern in liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.   under the scheme proposed by the us researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.   mr wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. the bees ""die"" when users stop requesting clips.   belgian scientist marco dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. but he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.   the bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.   this rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the lord of the rings movie currently being filmed in new zealand.   the troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.   battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.

       urllink are we not geeks?     tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks. i'd like to take a closer look at these labels.   consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.' the inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. well and good; evidently the ""inner child"" is regarded as good and precious. but what can we say about the inner adolescent? why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent?   i think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness. we haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. the author philip pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.   at that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: what is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.   i'd agree with that. i'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. as one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. i think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.   i'd like to throw in one of the ultimate romantic poems i've ever come across. it's by an argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:   for afterwards  i would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.  and in the final instants i would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.  to die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight.  to die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: i am yours although we know so well it will betray us.  manuel gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (translation: gordon challis)  yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. it is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. it offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. it may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. but would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? i could not bear the loss.   for this is the inner teenager that tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. they are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.   nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.   the whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. other people are involved in writing more about this, but i'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. firstly, what is a geek? articles like julian dibbell's 'lord of the geeks' article on village voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. they're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (and i might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)   my own definition of geeks is this: a geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. the link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play. it's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.   the larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. in their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.   there's always been geeks. mozart? what a nerd! he had to be a geek. who illuminated medieval manuscripts? who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the dark ages? geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! who were pythagoras and socrates and archimedes? total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds.   and so i ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: are we not geeks?   written by tehanu@theonering.net

       urllink self-help: divorce  divorce: a crisis, any way you look at it   if you are currently facing the realities of a divorce--either as a partner in a failing marriage, or as a child of parents whose marriage is ending--you are not alone. more than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.   divorce is a crisis of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. according to the dictionary, a ""crisis"" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. that is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. in fact, the chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning danger and opportunity. the process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.   the dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--loss. whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.   it is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. in these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.   a later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. it is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.   the dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. for children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. this loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. to help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. they need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. they need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. they need structure and routine and consistency. finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. and they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.   as stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. the crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. at this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. for many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.   for most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. there are many books available to assist you in these challenges. two useful ones are divorcing by kranzler and belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and how to survive the loss of a love by colgrove, bloomfiled and mcwilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce. consult with the counseling center in shoemaker hall (314-7651) or the mental health clinic in the health center (314-8106). they offer support and help.     the author, kathy zamostny, is a staff psychologist at the university counseling center.   this article was originally presented in the commuter connection, a production of the office of commuter affairs.

it is only potentially so.', 'in fact, the chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning danger and opportunity.', 'the process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.', 'the dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--loss.', 'whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce.', 'recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.', 'it is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma.', 'reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror.', 'in these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.', 'a later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning.', 'feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression.', 'again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate.', 'it is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.', 'the dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense.', 'for children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it.', 'this loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster.', 'furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings.', 'thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss.', 'to help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect.', 'they need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs.', 'they need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage.', 'they need structure and routine and consistency.', 'finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling.', 'and they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.', 'as stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity.', 'once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce.', 'the crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings.', 'it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment.', 'at this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience.', 'through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life.', 'for many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.', 'for most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous.', 'there are many books available to assist you in these challenges.', 'two useful ones are divorcing by kranzler and belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and how to survive the loss of a love by colgrove, bloomfiled and mcwilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general).', 'also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce.', 'consult with the counseling center in shoemaker hall (314-7651) or the mental health clinic in the health center (314-8106).', 'they offer support and help.', 'the author, kathy zamostny, is a staff psychologist at the university counseling center.', 'this article was originally presented in the commuter connection, a production of the office of commuter affairs.']"

       urllink   the four emotional stages of divorce work by phil rich, ed.d., msw. the end of marriage   the hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.   divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.   divorce is composed of both ""technical"" and ""emotional"" aspects. the technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. but the ""other"" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. this is ""divorce work"" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce.    the emotional stages of divorce  although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. at this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order. these are the ""emotional"" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.   the necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life    stage 1:  ""shock and disbelief"" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. it involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.  facing reality  self esteem and inadequacy  telling the world  support and help    stage 2:  ""initial adjustment"" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. the primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  functioning and responsibility  practical reality  legal matters  managing emotions    stage 3:  ""active re-organization"" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  managing life style and practical affairs  re-defining relationships  reconstructing personal values and beliefs  concluding legal procedures    stage 4:  ""life re-formation"" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the ""other"" side of their divorce. during this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.  constructing relationships  new interests  personal responsibility  accepting your new life    summary and conclusion  the first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. it's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. the second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. the final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. this stage really has no formal ""end,"" and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.   of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. and things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. but helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.   references:  burns b., & whiteman, t.

       urllink   question: you've discussed briefly some of the physiological and emotional differences between the sexes. could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?   dr. dobson responds:  men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of. here are just a few of those differences:   1. a woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the u.s. females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. more than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159   2. men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160   3. men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161   4. the sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. the first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162   5. women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163   6. women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. the glands work differently in the two sexes. for example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164   7. women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. when the working day in british factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165   8. men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166   9. women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167   10. female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168   11. women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169   12. men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. the implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. for example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. the young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170   who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?

      subject: story for you.... date: mon, 9 sep 2002 19:27:36 -0600 from: jafree to: heather   uniqueness  beyond superiority and inferiority  every human being is unique. there is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. yes, people are different.   let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. i am not saying that everybody is equal. nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. people are simply unique, incomparable. you are you, i am i. i have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life. i have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being.  when inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears. they live together, they cannot be separated. the man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere. the man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere. they come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated.   it happened... a very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a zen master. the samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, but looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior. maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority. he said to the master ""why am i feeling inferior? just a moment ago, everything was okay. as i entered into your court suddenly i felt inferior. i have never felt like that. my hands are shaking. i am a warrior, i have faced death many times, and i have never felt any fear--why am i feeling frightened?""   the master said, ""you wait. when everybody has gone, i will answer."" people continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired. by the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, ""now, can you answer it?"" and the master said, ""now, come outside.""   a full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... and he said, ""look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree. they both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem. the smaller tree has never said, 'why do i feel inferior before you?' to the big tree. how is it possible? this tree is small, and that tree is big, and i have never heard any whisper.""   the samurai said, ""because they can't compare.""   the master said, ""then you need not ask me; you know the answer.""   comparison brings inferiority, superiority. when you don't compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear. then you are, you are simply there. a small bush or a big high tree--it doesn't matter; you are yourself. you are needed. a grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star. without the grass leaf god will be less than he is. the sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears.   just look around. all is needed, and everything fits together. it is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior. everybody is incomparably unique.

       urllink haiku for beginners    i guess the first thing you noticed is that they're short - two or three lines only. there are not many words in those lines either. and you didn't hear rhymes, did you?   beyond their physical form, these poems obviously have something else in common. it is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation. if we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this.   the poems speak  - about experience from the senses  - directly and with intensity  - about observation of nature   they seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images. usually it is an image from nature or from daily life. perhaps though, to say that the poem 'constructs' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it. really the poem is reminding us of something we've already seen, heard or felt. that's how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words. one possibility is to go with what you know now.   let me first remind you of the rules i've already given you. the poem should be start with an image or a pair if them. it should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme. haiku is of course a traditional japanese form with further strict rules of construction. not all are honoured outside japan and even there some are defiantly broken. to what i've already stated let me add three more stipulations.   three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5  one kigo or season word  one kireji or cutting word   the first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku. the idea is simple. write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line. this gives you two short lines divided by a longer one. it goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem.   there is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let's skip that for the moment and talk about the third. the kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts. obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier. in english the tendency is to use punctuation, such as ""-"" or "":"" to perform this function.   the second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes. for english-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature.   but most important is that the form isn't the goal here. it's to write a good poem. so the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important. occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.

       urllink robert e. wilkinson 's the quantum brahman   in their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. the first of these categories is the gravitational force. it is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. the gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the sun, moon and planets. the second category is the electromagnetic force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. while it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. the third category called the weak nuclear force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. in 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. it is now called the electro-weak force. the fourth category, called the strong nuclear force, binds particles together into combinations. matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. the strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.   while these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. this problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the luminiferous ether. it was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. to the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. but, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the quantum vacuum. however, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the quantum vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. scientists now agree that it was the quantum vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. and they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. a number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a grand unified field formula.   the discovery of the quantum vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. physicists cautiously agree that the quantum vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. there is even a growing consensus among scientists that vacuum physics lie at the core of everything. but, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the quantum vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. they have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. the laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.   in order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the quantum vacuum and measure the density of the transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of time. for time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. for centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that time was a derivative of space even to the point of calling it 'space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; time is what gives birth to space.   in his commentaries on the brihadaranyaka upanishad, one of india's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, sri aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:   "" ... the [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) from the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. time in its period is the self of the horse sacrificial, so not matter but time, is the body of this force of the material universe... space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of time which the sage attributes to his horse of the worlds, by movement in space its periods are shaped and determined. hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of space, but the magnitudes of time... for time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in space possible.""   sri aurobindo, the upanishads; 'the great aranyaka', sri aurobindo ashram press, 1971  in the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. they may exist in being but not in time. they are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of time. for it is saturn/chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the supreme godhead into material form.   in its native state, the absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; one without a second. in order for the incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. it does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. it manifests first as cosmic and planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. through this alchemical process, the absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated unity into form and multiplicity. this act of contraction, is the basis upon which the greek myths portray saturn/chronos as having dismembered his father.   in order to break the code of the transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. it must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.   one of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, david bohm in his book, wholeness and the implicate order. using the language of mathematics, bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the explicate order.   ""the explicate order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the implicate order. it is the precursor of the explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. the implicate order implies within it all physical universes. however, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. it is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. the creative process springs from this realm. energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order.""   will keepin, david bohm, noetic science journal  when bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.   the zero point order which bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of indian metaphysics known as the brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as absolute being. realization of the brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of time and consciousness which we experience as timelessness, or undifferentiated time. in this state time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. hence it cannot produce any form or any division of consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in space.   in the language of physics the brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as emptiness or a void. it appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. the amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. in this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. his calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this zero point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.   bohm's work with zero point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the absolute or brahman becomes manifest in time and space. and while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like sri aurobindo, bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits emptiness or a void as the highest spiritual realization.   ""nothing can arise from nothing. asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, ""here there is nothing."" out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. but what in truth is this zero? it is an incalculable infinite... our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. in truth there is nothing but light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range.""  sri aurobindo, the web of yoga, centenary edition, vol. 17, p. 48  bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish fullness rather than a void as the ground state of the universe. the implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of spirit and matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.   while these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of vedic india. long ago the rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the etheric plenum, or fullness from which all things emerge. according to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that etheric plenum. the atharva veda describes that point or seed as an 'embryo [hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.' this embryo or seed lies at the intersection of time and space, spirit and matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. in the language of scientific cosmology, this point or seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. in metaphysical terms it is the luminiferous ether, the om or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. all material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the seer to follow the evolving in our time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.   knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the vedic rishis because it allowed them to follow the unfolding of that seed and 'see' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. they were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. this knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the rig veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. the seer became displaced by the nirvani as emphasis shifted from gnosis to a philosophy of illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a transcendent consciousness. as a result of this development, the bridge between the transcendent and the physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. it was understood that the brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the all was once again a great mystery.   ""when the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. more importantly, that essence itself became deformed. the experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. this was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on earth. above all, creation became divested of true sacredness.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet, the vishaal newsletter, october, 1988  today, some two thousand years later, science and spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that truth or salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. the influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven science and spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. the key to that paradigm is a new understanding of time and its primary role bridging the transcendent and the physical world.   ""it cannot be denied that time is a major feature of our material universe. in consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate time. conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of time. furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet, the new way, vol. 3, 1983  in the early 1970's patrizia norelli-bachelet, the world's leading authority on vedic cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. she had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient india evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. the rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. their knowledge of time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as truth-consciousness or swar of the veda. the rishis understood that the cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. they also knew that the difference between man/woman and the cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the macrocosm and microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. if man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of cosmic time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. since the same zero womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of truth-consciousness or gnosis.   this was the essence of the rig vedic yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by patrizia norelli-bachelet. from the principles of these ancient teachings, ms. norelli-bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, the gnostic circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.   ""the gnostic circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. the circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of earth life. the joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the spirit. in fact we can say that the gnostic circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet ,the gnostic circle, p. 159, 1975  ms. norelli-bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of time and measure. her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of time as the integrative mechanism by which a divine purpose is expressed in the world. her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material reality which include the being as well as the dynamics of the becoming of that same being. ""time"", says norelli-bachelet, ""is the vehicle, the medium for the absolute or supreme consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the spiritual and physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the supreme within the physical manifestation .""   in ms. norelli-bachelet's cosmology, the zero womb or what science is now calling the quantum vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the sun or primary axis of our own universe. the nine planets which orbit about the sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that zero/womb/axis. the planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called cabalistic reduction. since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of number and relate the movement of the spheres to the calendar which measures time periods on earth. through this system of cosmic harmonies, the gnostic circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between time and space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.   by unveiling the quantum brahman or body of the absolute, ms. norelli-bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the zero womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. she has rebuilt the bridge between spirit and matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. through the use of her gnostic circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the explicate universe. ms. norelli-bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.   2/12/96   robert e. wilkinson    p. o. box 396  accord, new york 12404

which they interact.', 'the first of these categories is the gravitational force.', 'it is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force.', 'the gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the sun, moon and planets.', 'the second category is the electromagnetic force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles.', 'while it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another.', 'the third category called the weak nuclear force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos.', 'in 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism.', 'it is now called the electro-weak force.', 'the fourth category, called the strong nuclear force, binds particles together into combinations.', 'matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks.', 'the strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.', 'while these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe.', 'this problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification.', 'their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the luminiferous ether.', 'it was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances.', 'to the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions.', 'but, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field.', 'leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation.', 'since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the quantum vacuum.', 'however, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the quantum vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe.', 'scientists now agree that it was the quantum vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe.', 'and they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum.', 'a number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a grand unified field formula.', 'the discovery of the quantum vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon.', 'physicists cautiously agree that the quantum vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter.', 'there is even a growing consensus among scientists that vacuum physics lie at the core of everything.', 'but, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the quantum vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go.', 'they have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable.', 'the laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.', 'in order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the quantum vacuum and measure the density of the transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of time.', 'for time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter.', ""for centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that time was a derivative of space even to the point of calling it 'space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; time is what gives birth to space."", 'in his commentaries on the brihadaranyaka upanishad, one of india\'s oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, sri

well as the dynamics of the becoming of that same being.', '""time"", says norelli-bachelet, ""is the vehicle, the medium for the absolute or supreme consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the spiritual and physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the supreme within the physical manifestation .""', ""in ms. norelli-bachelet's cosmology, the zero womb or what science is now calling the quantum vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the sun or primary axis of our own universe."", 'the nine planets which orbit about the sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that zero/womb/axis.', 'the planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called cabalistic reduction.', 'since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of number and relate the movement of the spheres to the calendar which measures time periods on earth.', 'through this system of cosmic harmonies, the gnostic circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between time and space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.', 'by unveiling the quantum brahman or body of the absolute, ms. norelli-bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the zero womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form.', 'she has rebuilt the bridge between spirit and matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order.', 'through the use of her gnostic circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the explicate universe.', ""ms. norelli-bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary

       urllink you create your world   this chapter excerpt is from the book hermes reality creator i. it is © copyright 1999-2003 by hermes trismegistus. please follow the copyright link for additional copyright information. or go to one of the following links for final version copies or reality creator books & supplies. http://www.wisdomsdoor.com / http://www.realitycreatorbooks.com  note: this chapter is an exact copy of the printed book version!  i think - therefore i am  you create your world! no other concept possesses the power that this idea does. think about it? the power to change your world rests within yourself – within your mind!    thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. this physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. when you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. you make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. remember! you have a right to create your own world.    that right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers – divine powers, we might add – who cherish that right themselves. they would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation.    to reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. doing both will take time. however, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation.    to begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you can’t control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality.    learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. good reality-control comes from within, not without. an uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. this untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. all these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. when a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beast’s world. this haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. your consciousness’s driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants.    now, to help make our point, let’s take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.      does you mind wander regularly – jumping from topic to topic? in other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.   do you continually look on the negative side of things? a negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness – not you! emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. however, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.   do you often feel mentally drained? continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. with inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. if you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.   do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? not knowing how a device operates – especially an inner device – can greatly hinder your ability to use it. a computer is no good if you haven’t a clue how to operate it! thought-creation is the same. your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. otherwise, you’ll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. while the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. so, if you don’t understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level.    i’m sure many of you answered ‘yes’ to some of these questions. answering ‘yes’ does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. you must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others.    with a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. for one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. you will create the world you want and need. there will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. if you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. you will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. when an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. you will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny.    you create your world! no other statement is more true. now it is your job to learn how. take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. you’ve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. then, let’s take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools – inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness.      worksheet notes:   on the next page is your first worksheet. it is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after you’ve finished the “hermes’ reality creator i” course and retake the test. your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the reality creating game. each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill.   question one shows you how positively you think about your reality.  question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will.  question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment.  question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy).  question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others.   after you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on. as we get to that part of the book, you may want to pay extra attention to that section.

       urllink quitnet quitguide  physical addiction within just 7-10 seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine begins affecting your brain.  nicotine acts on cells in the “reward center” of the brain.  this results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the ""hit"" that your body comes to expect.  when bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated.  however, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine.  you then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued.  you begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues.  this cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive.   essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the ‘comfort zone’.

       urllink people with moon in virgo  does this sound like me?   moon in virgo earth sign   emotionally spontaneous is not a phrase to describe a virgoan moon personality. like their companion in the earth signs, taurus, there isn’t the headlong rushing into commitments, either. virgoan moons don’t overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves. they may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement.   as lunar earth sign personalities, those with moon in virgo are guarded about their feelings. virgoan moons don’t much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio. this is not an ego issue like their neighbor, leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately. it isn’t easy loving a person with a virgo moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions. believe it or not, this moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions. their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion. an over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings. serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic. as a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions. this leads virgoan moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it.  virgo moon personalities are emotionally adaptable. they instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better. they make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited. though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing. intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip. at times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits. concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals. their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy. they are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information.

""true compassion,"" king declared, ""is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.""  by 1967, king had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the vietnam war, and a staunch critic of overall u.s. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. in his ""beyond vietnam"" speech delivered at new york's riverside church on april 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- king called the united states ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.""  >from vietnam to south africa to latin america, king said, the u.s. was ""on the wrong side of a world revolution."" king questioned ""our alliance with the landed gentry of latin america,"" and asked why the u.s. was suppressing revolutions ""of the shirtless and barefoot people"" in the third world, instead of supporting them.  in foreign policy, king also offered an economic critique, complaining about ""capitalists of the west investing huge sums of money in asia, africa and south america, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries.""  you haven't heard the ""beyond vietnam"" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. time magazine called it ""demagogic slander that sounded like a script for radio hanoi."" the washington post patronized that ""king has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.""  in his last months, king was organizing the most militant project of his life: the poor people's campaign. he crisscrossed the country to assemble ""a multiracial army of the poor"" that would descend on washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the capitol, if need be-- until congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights. reader's digest warned of an ""insurrection.""  king's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild america's cities. he saw a crying need to confront a congress that had demonstrated its ""hostility to the poor""-- appropriating ""military funds with alacrity and generosity,"" but providing ""poverty funds with miserliness.""  how familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after king's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet.  as 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the white house and congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. and so do most mass media. perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of martin luther king's life.  ------------------ media beat is norman solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics. until 1996, the column was co-written by fair's founder, jeff cohen (cohen no longer works at fair). for more media beat columns, visit:  urllink http://www.fair.org/media-beat/index.html   ------------------ you can listen to some of martin luther king jr.'s anti-war speeches, including the riverside church speech, at the national radio project's website:   urllink http://www.radioproject.org/temp/king.html         ---------- please support fair by subscribing to our bimonthly magazine, extra! for more information, go to:  urllink http://www.fair.org/extra/subscribe.html . or call 1-800-847-3993.  fair shirts: get your ""don't trust the corporate media"" shirt today at fair's online store: http://www.merchantamerica.com/fair/  fair produces counterspin, a weekly radio show heard on over 130 stations in the u.s. and canada. to find the counterspin station nearest you, visit  http://www.fair.org/counterspin/stations.html .  fair's internship program: fair accepts internship applications for its new york office on a rolling basis. for more information, see:  http://www.fair.org/internships.html  feel free to respond to fair ( fair@fair.org ). we can't reply to everything, but we will look at each message. we especially appreciate documented examples of media bias or censorship. and please send copies of your email correspondence with media outlets, including any responses, to fair@fair.org .  you can subscribe to fair-l at our web site: http://www.fair.org . our subscriber list is kept confidential.                                   fair                              (212) 633-6700                           http://www.fair.org/                           e-mail: fair@fair.org

it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.""', ""by 1967, king had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the vietnam war, and a staunch critic of overall u.s. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic."", 'in his ""beyond vietnam"" speech delivered at new york\'s riverside church on april 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- king called the united states ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.""', '>from vietnam to south africa to latin america, king said, the u.s. was ""on the wrong side of a world revolution.""', 'king questioned ""our alliance with the landed gentry of latin america,"" and asked why the u.s. was suppressing revolutions ""of the shirtless and barefoot people"" in the third world, instead of supporting them.', 'in foreign policy, king also offered an economic critique, complaining about ""capitalists of the west investing huge sums of money in asia, africa and south america, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries.""', 'you haven\'t heard the ""beyond vietnam"" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it.', 'time magazine called it ""demagogic slander that sounded like a script for radio hanoi.""', 'the washington post patronized that ""king has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.""', ""in his last months, king was organizing the most militant project of his life: the poor people's campaign."", 'he crisscrossed the country to assemble ""a multiracial army of the poor"" that would descend on washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the capitol, if need be-- until congress enacted a poor people\'s bill of rights.', 'reader\'s digest warned of an ""insurrection.""', ""king's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild america's cities."", 'he saw a crying need to confront a congress that had demonstrated its ""hostility to the poor""-- appropriating ""military funds with alacrity and generosity,"" but providing ""poverty funds with miserliness.""', ""how familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after king's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet."", 'as 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the white house and congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty.', 'and so do most mass media.', ""perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of martin luther king's life."", ""------------------ media beat is norman solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics."", ""until 1996, the column was co-written by fair's founder, jeff cohen (cohen no longer works at fair)."", ""for more media beat columns, visit:  urllink http://www.fair.org/media-beat/index.html   ------------------ you can listen to some of martin luther king jr.'s anti-war speeches, including the riverside church speech, at the national radio project's website:   urllink http://www.radioproject.org/temp/king.html         ---------- please support fair by subscribing to our bimonthly magazine, extra!"", 'for more information, go to:  urllink http://www.fair.org/extra/subscribe.html .', 'or call 1-800-847-3993.  fair shirts: get your ""don\'t trust the corporate media"" shirt today at fair\'s online store: http://www.merchantamerica.com/fair/  fair produces counterspin, a weekly radio show heard on over 130 stations in the u.s. and canada.', 'to find the counterspin station nearest you, visit  http://www.fair.org/counterspin/stations.html .', ""fair's internship program: fair accepts internship applications for its new york office on a rolling basis."", 'for more information, see:  http://www.fair.org/internships.html  feel free to respond to fair ( fair@fair.org ).', ""we can't reply to everything, but we will look at each message."", 'we especially appreciate documented examples of media bias or censorship.', 'and please send copies of your email correspondence with media outlets, including any responses, to fair@fair.org .', 'you can subscribe to fair-l at our web site: http://www.fair.org .', 'our subscriber list is kept confidential.', 'fair                              (212) 633-6700                           http://www.fair.org/                           e-mail: fair@fair.org']"

       urllink tnt - the power within you  from raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 am   stop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. you have only two choices. you can either go higher or lower. you may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about ""what might have been"" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself ""it's too late now"".  but if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have ""gotten wise to themselves"", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. you discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you.  a deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. there has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing. not only this but you realize that you have been missing out on many things in life of far greater value than many of the things you thought you had to have a short time ago.....there is no way out, there is no way back, there is no other way but through.......claude m. bristol and harold sherman

       urllink halliburton subsidiary wins iraqi oil firefighting contract  washington (afp) - the us army said it gave the main iraqi oilwell firefighting contract to a unit of halliburton co., a firm once run by vice president dick cheney without any bidding.   kellogg, brown and root, a unit of houston, texas-based halliburton, was handed the contract by the army corps of engineers, which has been placed in charge of fighting the blazes.   the contract had not been put out to tender, said the corps spokesman, lieutenant colonel gene pawlik.   kellogg, brown and root (kbr) had already been asked by the pentagon (news - web sites) to draw up plans for extinguishing oil well fires in iraq (news - web sites), pawlik noted.   ""it made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed,"" he said.   the value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work.   the chief of britain's armed forces, admiral sir michael boyce, said friday that iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country.   kbr would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, pawlik said.   ""kbr was selected for this award based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice,"" the company said in a statement.   kbr said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase.   the company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the corps spokesman said.   kbr chose houston-based boots and coots international, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and wild well control inc. as firefighting subcontractors.   president george w. bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, ari fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.   asked about the contracting process, fleischer told a news conference: ""the question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. refer your question to the agencies involved. i am not familiar with the details of this contract.""   in a statement late monday, the defense department said the army corps of engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.   kellogg, brown and root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, pentagon said. the contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.   ""we have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment,"" boots and coots president brian krause said in a statement.   ""we will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure,"" he said.   boots and coots was brought into kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the gulf war (news - web sites), it said.   cheney was chief executive of the kbr parent company halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.

       voyeurism   urllink war in the digital age: did you see that?  by francis till   digital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome.  anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy bbc news. that link works on internet-capable pdas, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a starbucks anywhere.  very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the tigris river as iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed american pilots.  the soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road.   the audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire.  al jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the qatar-based station put its images up to satellites.  on bbc webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience. bbc's webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel's broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example.  according to the presenters, raf sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing. within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the pentagon making similar statements about american aircraft. yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out.  al jazeera reported on television at that point that one american pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman. according to al jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down. al jazeera did not use modifiers.  sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted us central command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down.  on the webstream feed, the sky over bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles.  meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack. hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases. now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target. a target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in bagdhad today.  as the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over sky news from american secretary of defense donald rumsfeld that, indeed, a uk warplane, with two pilots, was missing. not the tornado shot down earlier by an american patriot missile, but another.  but then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege.  and finally, an astute bbc reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes. which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane.  bbc world news, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (london time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that rumsfeld had said american soldiers were missing and that an ""allied aircraft"" was missing. bbc's on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in washington only moments before.  to no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in.  in america, england, australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread. they were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of nancy chamberlin, the wife of a fallen marine, who had told nbc anchor tom browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what ""all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes. but for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder. it's heartbreak. we can't leave the television. every tank, every helicopter. is that my son?"" after she hung up the phone, brokaw broke up on the air. ""war is not about technology,"" he said. ""behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk,"" lostremote reported.  and, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. and, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.  it's difficult to lie when the cameras are on.  and the cameras are always on, these days.  even at 50 miles-per-hour.  spectacular footage from nbc reporter david bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. the equipment is from maritime telecommunications network (mtn), of miramar, florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.  but even though it is all digital, it's not all cameras.  the websites of iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. the websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. by sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the uruklink sites, and while the iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to ""live coverage"" was broken.  the iraqi news agency site, part of the uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. it contains an outdated link to the former website of the iraq satellite channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.  according to brian mcwilliams of pc-radio.com, ""web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching uruklink.net, the iraq government's main website, after the us launched its initial attack wednesday night. but those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.  ""in fact, traffic to uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. the homepage of uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. that would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in december. the previous traffic record occurred on feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the drudge report.""  mcwilliams told politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist declan mccullagh, that the main iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.  we suggest sending email to saddam.   - www.nbr.co.nz

      osho zen tarot    trust     don't waste your life for that which is going to be taken away. trust life. if you trust, only then can you drop your knowledge, only then can you put your mind aside. and with trust, something immense opens up. then this life is no longer ordinary life, it becomes full of god, overflowing.   when the heart is innocent and the walls have disappeared, you are bridged with infinity. and you are not deceived; there is nothing that can be taken away from you. that which can be taken away from you is not worth keeping, and that which cannot be taken away from you... why should one be afraid of its being taken away? it cannot be taken away, there is no possibility. you cannot lose your real treasure.  osho the sun rises in the evening chapter 9  commentary:  now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! and it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the knight of water demands from us.   there is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. and when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. we don't say, ""okay, i trust that i know what to do now, and i'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me."" no, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. the leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky.   the card gives a hint here, though, about what waits for us at the other end - a soft, welcoming, yummy pink, rose petals, juicy...c'mon!

       urllink weekly review - may 27, 2003: harper's magazine  the united states and several other countries banned canadian beef after a mad cow was discovered in alberta. officials were quick to point out that there was no evidence that beef from the cow, which was slaughtered in january, had entered the food chain, although they admitted that the carcass had been sent to a rendering plant and that the protein produced by the plant is sometimes used in pet food. ""i want to stress from the beginning this is one cow,"" said the minister of agriculture. ""don't try to leave the impression that this animal went into the feed chain."" last year more than 500,000 head of cattle were exported from alberta to the united states. prime minister jean chretien made a public show of eating a steak. sars continued to spread in toronto, and britain's foreign office told travelers to avoid taiwan because of the continuing outbreak there. the sars virus was found in six masked palm civit cats and in a raccoon dog; sars antibodies were also found in a chinese ferret badger. investigators said it was probable that the virus had jumped from one of the chinese delicacies to humans. a new television channel devoted exclusively to sars opened in singapore. a british man who walked alone to the north pole was sitting there waiting for somebody to come give him a ride home, and a 70-year-old japanese man climbed mount everest. a wild turkey was found perched on a 28th-floor balcony in manhattan.   american intelligence officials decided that two trailers found in iraq were used to manufacture bioweapons even though they had found no evidence that the trailers were used for that purpose. bush administration officials claimed to have ""rock-hard intelligence"" that an al qaeda cell operating in iran had directed the recent bombings in saudi arabia. donald rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, was asked to describe the role played by the iranian cell; he said he knew but wasn't ""going to get into it. that's for others to do."" state department officials revealed that the administration was planning to destabilize the iranian government; others were more worried about the al qaeda cells in saudi arabia said to be plotting new attacks. american interrogators were forcing iraqi prisoners to listen to songs by the rock band metallica — as well as the ""sesame street"" theme song and the ""i love you"" song by barney the purple dinosaur — in order to make them talk. ""these people haven't heard heavy metal. they can't take it,"" said one psy ops officer. ""if you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. that's when we come in and talk to them."" the pentagon announced that it was changing the name of the total information awareness project to ""terrorist information awareness."" the program will search for data patterns that suggest terrorist activity; the project is also funding research into ""human kinematics"" and ""gait recognition,"" apparently so that terrorists can be identified by their ""walking style."" it occurred to several prominent democratic senators that the president might have deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by iraq in order to scare people into supporting an invasion. senator pat roberts, a republican from kansas, said he believed that weapons of mass destruction would be found, but added that ""basically, you have a real credibility problem"" if they are not. former iraqi soldiers were beginning to get restless; about 50 demonstrated in basra and demanded that their salaries be paid by the occupiers: ""if they don't pay us, we'll start problems,"" said one. ""we have guns at home. if they don't pay us, if they make our children suffer, they'll hear from us."" members of the arab saraefien tribe near the iranian border were also threatening to take up arms. ""the americans promised us food and medicine and freedom. but we have lost our homes, our land, our crops. now we live in prison with nothing, and they ignore us,"" said hadeb hamed hamed, the tribe's sheikh.

""it is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press,"" said ali abdel-amir, senior editor of nidaa al-mustaqbal, a newspaper of the iraqi national accord, a longtime umbrella organization for iraqi opposition groups.   ""there is anarchy now,"" abdel-amir said. ""many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective.""   the u.s.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by saddam's elder son, odai. information radio features news announcements, arabic music and even western music like the occasional rendition of ""the power of love"" by huey lewis and the news.   another station, radio of the iraqi republic, run by former information ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future.   in baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring iran, primarily the arabic-language al-aalam.   ali al-fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for assaah is much better.   ""there is more freedom and more openness,"" he said. ""the red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats.""

       why are women leaving corporate america and where are they going? by denise gürer   urllink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp   in today’s fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime.  even so, women are leaving corporate america at twice the rate of men.  why are they leaving and where are they going?  many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.  many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.  many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate america is not willing to give.  many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.  for all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.  a majority of these organizations are wildly successful.  women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the u.s. overall economic health and competitiveness.    why are women leaving? even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snail’s pace.  the glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.  thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.  in fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (moore and buttner 1997).  in addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.  in a different study by catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (catalyst 1998).  this suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.  this further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their company’s direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.  in many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.  this cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity.    another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.  in fact, pay equity is still a problem.  in the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (chao 2001).  more specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (usdol 2001).  another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.  however there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.  this discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.  to counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.  many view this support as something the company should provide.  when the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.  how can corporations reverse this trend? in today’s knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.  the loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.  all of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (donahue 1998).    a corporation’s first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.  this could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.  statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.  these could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.  gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.  in particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company.    it is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.  based on this “research”, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.  it is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.  managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity.    some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.   women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (van velsor and hughes 1990).  thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.  another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.  this is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).  other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation.    essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?  if business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.  given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.  characteristics and culture of women owned businesses starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.  however, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.  they are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles.    for high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.  just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (nfwbo 2001b).  this follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the u.s.  the most recent statistics from the department of education show women graduates at 58.3% of b.s. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (nces 2001).   no matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.  nfwbo found that 53% of women business owners emphasize “right-brain” thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (nfwbo 1994).  the same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events.    the attributes of a company’s leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.  women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in “family” terms and work within a network of business relationships.  men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (nfwbo 1994; gürer 2001).  the nfwbo study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.  men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.  thus, women’s leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a “web of inclusion” (see gürer 2001; helgesen 1995), while men’s leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.   another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees’ lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.  only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.  for large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (nfwbo 1994).  in addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses.    diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.  not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.  women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).  men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (nfwbo 2000a).    the success of women-owned businesses from an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.  in 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (nfwbo 1999).  of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.  these businesses are also financially stable.  women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all u.s. firms (cwbr 1995).  businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.  the growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (uscb 1997).  from 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.  with respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (nfwbo 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector.    still some difficulties even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.  one key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.  these are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.    women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.  only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.  in addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual “angel” investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (nfwbo 2000b).  women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (nfwbo 2001b).  this reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.    given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.  there are currently programs that strive towards these goals – many of which can be linked to via the center for women's business research’s website at http://www.nfwbo.org  catalyst for change? the management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.  interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.  a recent survey of technology professionals by webgrrls, in western new york, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (drury 2001).  men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.  in addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.  it is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.  however, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.  the webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.  even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.  as the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.  the tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.  regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.  these businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the fortune 500 companies of the future.  references catalyst (1998) women entrepreneurs: why companies lose female talent and what they can do about it, see  urllink

business, or an executive professional background.', 'these are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.', 'women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.', 'only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.', 'in addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual “angel” investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (nfwbo 2000b).', 'women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (nfwbo 2001b).', 'this reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.', 'given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.', ""there are currently programs that strive towards these goals – many of which can be linked to via the center for women's business research’s website at http://www.nfwbo.org  catalyst for change?"", 'the management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.', 'interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.', 'a recent survey of technology professionals by webgrrls, in western new york, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (drury 2001).', 'men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.', 'in addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.', 'it is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.', 'however, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.', 'the webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.', 'even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.', 'as the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.', 'the tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.', 'regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.', 'these businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become

       urllink researchers create flexible, paper-thin electronic screen  associated press  in a step toward electronic newspapers and wearable computer screens, scientists have created an ultra-thin screen that can be bent, twisted and even rolled up and still display crisp text.  the material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen.  the screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality.  although it's not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it's the first flexible computer screen of its kind.  ``i think it's a major step forward. we have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,'' said yu chen, a research scientist with e ink corp. of cambridge, mass.  e ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper'' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it.  the new screen is described in thursday's issue of the journal nature.  aris silzars, the past president of the san jose, calif.-based society for information display, said one of the technology's first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops.  but silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which e ink is still developing, may not be evident. ``it's very hard to predict where this thing may go,'' he said.  chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink.  that ``ink,'' developed in 1997 by a massachusetts institute of technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid.  when a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule's top. a positive current does the same to the negative black particles.  the human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column.  currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup. but chen's team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection.  they also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page'' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video.  another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors.  robert wisnieff, senior manager of ibm corp.'s advanced display technology laboratory in yorktown heights, n.y., said e ink's flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life.  he envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases.  another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city.  ``this is a peek at the future,'' wisnieff said.  on the net: nature: http://www.nature.com e ink corp: http://www.eink.com

       urllink inner voice  if you have found your truth within yourself there is nothing more in this whole existence to find. truth is functioning through you. when you open your eyes, it is truth opening his eyes. when you close your eyes, it is truth who is closing its eyes.   this is a tremendous meditation. if you can simply understand the device, you don't have to do anything; whatever you are doing is being done by truth. you are walking, it is truth; you are sleeping, it is truth resting; you are speaking, it is truth speaking; you are silent, it is truth that is silent.   this is one of the most simple meditation techniques. slowly, slowly everything settles by this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. when you are cured, you throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. then you live as truth - alive, radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. your whole life becomes a prayer without any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world.  osho the great zen master ta hui chapter 23  commentary:  the inner voice speaks not in words but in the wordless language of the heart. it is like an oracle who only speaks the truth. if it had a face, it would be like the face at the center of this card - alert, watchful, and able to accept both the dark and the light, symbolized by the two hands holding the crystal. the crystal itself represents the clarity that comes from transcending all dualities.   the inner voice can also be playful, as it dives deep into the emotions and emerges again to soar towards the sky, like two dolphins dancing in the waters of life. it is connected with the cosmos, through the crescent-moon crown, and the earth, as represented by the green leaves on the figure's kimono.   there are times in our lives when too many voices seem to be pulling us this way and that. our very confusion in such situations is a reminder to seek silence and centering within. only then are we able to hear our truth.

       urllink who am i? - (nan yar?)   as all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery, as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self, and as happiness alone is the cause for love, in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep where there is no mind, one should know one's self. for that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form ""who am i?"", is the principal means.    1 . who am i ? the gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), i am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, i am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, i am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., i am not; even the mind which thinks, i am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, i am not.   2. if i am none of these, then who am i? after negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that awareness which alone remains - that i am.   3. what is the nature of awareness? the nature of awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss   4. when will the realization of the self be gained? when the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the self which is the seer.   5. will there not be realization of the self even while the world is there (taken as real)? there will not be.   6. why? the seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.   7. when will the world which is the object seen be removed? when the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.   8. what is the nature of the mind? what is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the self. it causes all thoughts to arise. apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. therefore, thought is the nature of mind. apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. in deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. in the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. when the mind comes out of the self, the world appears. therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the self does not appear; and when the self appears (shines) the world does not appear. when one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the self (as the residue). what is referred to as the self is the atman. the mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. it is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).   9. what is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? that which rises as 'i' in this body is the mind. if one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'i' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. that is the place of the mind's origin. even if one thinks constantly 'i' 'i', one will be led to that place. of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'i' thought is the first. it is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. it is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.   10. how will the mind become quiescent? by the inquiry 'who am i?'. the thought 'who am i?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. then, there will arise self-realization.   11. what is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'who am i?' when other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'to whom do they arise?' it does not matter how many thoughts arise. as each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, ""to whom has this thought arisen?"". the answer that would emerge would be ""to me"". thereupon if one inquires ""who am i?"", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. with repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. when the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the heart is what is called ""inwardness"" (antar-mukha). letting the mind go out of the heart is known as ""externalisation"" (bahir-mukha). thus, when the mind stays in the heart, the 'i' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the self which ever exists will shine. whatever one does, one should do without the egoity ""i"". if one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of siva (god).   12. are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. if through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. the source is the same for both mind and breath. thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. the thought ""i"" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. it is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. but in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. this is because of the will of god, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. in the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. breath is the gross form of mind. till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of god, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.   through meditation on the forms of god and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. the mind will always be wandering. just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. when the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind self-inquiry will become easy. of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to self-inquiry.   13. the residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. when will all of them get destroyed? as the meditation on the self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.   14. is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure self? without yielding to the doubt ""is it possible, or not?"", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the self. even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep ""o! i am a sinner, how can i be saved?""; one should completely renounce the thought ""i am a sinner""; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the self; then, one would surely succeed. there are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. it is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. when the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. the mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. however bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. both desire and hatred should be eschewed. all that one gives to others one gives to one's self. if this truth is understood who will not give to others? when one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. to the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. if the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.   15. how long should inquiry be practised? as long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry ""who am i?"" is required. as thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. if one resorts to contemplation of the self unintermittently, until the self is gained, that alone would do. as long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.   16. what is the nature of the self? what exists in truth is the self alone. the world, the individual soul, and god are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. the self is that where there is absolutely no ""i"" thought. that is called ""silence"". the self itself is the world; the self itself is ""i""; the self itself is god; all is siva, the self.   17. is not everything the work of god? without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of god that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. god has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to him. that is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.   18. of the devotees, who is the greatest? he who gives himself up to the self that is god is the most excellent devotee. giving one's self up to god means remaining constantly in the self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the self. whatever burdens are thrown on god, he bears them. since the supreme power of god makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? we know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?   19. what is non-attachment? as thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the self-pearl.   20. is it not possible for god and the guru to effect the release of a soul? god and the guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. in truth, god and the guru are not different. just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the guru's gracious look will be saved by the guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by god or guru and gain release. one can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's. does he who is rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is rama?   21. is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the self. the world should be considered like a dream.   22. is there no difference between waking and dream? waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. in dream the mind takes on another body. in both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously.   23. is it any use reading books for those who long for release? all the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. in order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's self is; how could this search be done in books? one should know one's self with one's own eye of wisdom. the self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. since the self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. there will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.   24. what is happiness? happiness is the very nature of the self; happiness and the self are not different. there is no happiness in any object of the world. we imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. when the mind goes out, it experiences misery. in truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the self. similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure self-happiness. thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the self and returning to it. under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. a person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. a wise man stays permanently in the shade. similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave brahman. the mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to brahman to experience happiness. in fact, what is called the world is only thought. when the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.   25. what is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. to remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the self. telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.   26. what is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? desirelessness is wisdom. the two are not different; they are the same. desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. wisdom means the appearance of no object. in other words, not seeking what is other than the self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the self is wisdom.   27. what is the difference between inquiry and meditation? inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the self. meditation consists in thinking that one's self is brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.   28. what is release? inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release.   sri ramanarpanam astu

""the other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people,"" he added.   lacking relevance?   the other reason why sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.   it was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.   there are some who opt for sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades.   but most students learn the language to know about the past. some study sanskrit to improve their grades. there is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.   critics of sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.   however, sanskrit scholars like girish jani rubbish this approach.   ""why should we read shakespeare? why should we read sartre? are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? no.   ""we, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need sanskrit.""   scholars like mr jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,   but the sad reality is that sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.

      damn, this article is about my friend bill and his cars.    urllink south seattle star : heap of the week    bill jacobs' '69 dodge van isn't pretty, but in some ways that makes it all the better for the uses he puts it to. on a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his beacon hill home, and a slant-6 engine jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a '63 dart. and there was a toyota engine in there, too. (jacobs is partial to old dodges and toyotas. he also owns a banged-up toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. he replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)   the van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. and then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. one previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. and back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.  ""i don't think they called it that back then,"" jacobs said. ""i think they called it the dog-catcher van. it was up in the san juan islands; i think that's why it has the rust.""  in the three or four years he has owned it, jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. ""it was so much work getting it out, i figured i would do it all,"" he said.  ""i'm not going to tell you how much money i've put into it,"" he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.  ""i found the van on the internet,"" jacobs said. ""this guy wanted $400 for it. the picture looked so good, but when i got there it looked like (bleep!)."" so jacobs bargained the price down.  ""i paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt,"" he said. ""they don't sell these anymore, so i had to have it rebuilt.""    jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade (""i don't know if i'll keep doing this kind of work,"" he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. and while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.   ""there's no way i could ever sell it and get back what i've put into it,"" he said.  that rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could.  ""it would be nice to say that,"" he said. ""it doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done.""

      here's what the doctor says i have -  acute bronchitis  bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). the inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. when the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. in response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain.

""no."" she smiled on, ""they are very nice. have you tried them before? you should try!"" i smiled weakly, ""okay one poori and one nan."" i tried poori before, but prefer nan. but she was so unknowingly pushy that i patronised her. she walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, ""was the poori nice?"" my friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. she too prefers nan. the waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another ""happy"" customer.   i call this ""the poori effect."" it is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions. the waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. due to the way she carried herself, we ""naturally obliged"". we were later ""obliged"" to give her a positive response- out of ""courtesy"". the result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. we might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. we sometimes ""unwittingly"" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. but is your smile true? on the other hand, is your smiling ""forcing"" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? we see what we want to see. i know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. the poori effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. we are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. this is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. when we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? since it is ""sugar-coated"" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right?    asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. ""no no, what does he know? pooris are the best!"" do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? but what is the truth about preferences and opinions? preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. pooris might taste much better if i let go of my aversion? nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?   let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. the more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. when we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. this is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to enlightenment! -  urllink shian@thedailyenlightenment.com

        urllink weekly review - sep 9, 2003: harper's magazine   president george w. bush made a televised address to the nation and declared that iraq was now the ""central front"" in the war on terrorism. he called for national resolve and national sacrifice and said that he will ask congress for $87 billion in emergency funds for the occupation. it was noted that this new request, which comes on top of $79 billion already approved, will probably push the current budget deficit up to $600 billion. howard dean said the speech, which made no mention of osama bin laden, was ""outrageous"" and said it reminded him of lyndon johnson and the vietnam war. senator bob graham observed that bush now wants to spend more on iraq this year than the federal government will spend on education. gunmen fired on a sunni mosque in baghdad just after morning prayers and injured three people, a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the baghdad police department, a british bomb squad expert was killed, an american humvee was blown up, and lt. gen. ricardo sanchez said that attacks on american forces were down to about 14 or 15 a day. defense secretary donald rumsfeld, who was touring iraq and afghanistan, complained that the news media was ignoring ""the story of success and accomplishment"" in iraq. rumsfeld acknowledged that he still doesn't know who is carrying out the guerrilla attacks but said that the intelligence community is working on it. ""they're not comfortable at the moment with what we don't know."" a man died and several others were injured while riding disneyland's big thunder mountain railroad. the world council of churches denounced the invasion of iraq as ""immoral"" and ""ill advised"" and called for the withdrawal of american forces. a congressional study found that the occupation of iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the u.s. military, and the united states released a draft resolution calling on the united nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for iraq that would remain under american military and political control. heavy fighting continued in afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in baghdad. donald rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. rumsfeld claimed that there has been ""breathtaking"" progress in afghanistan since the war ended. ""i'm not being pollyannaish,"" he said. ""i'm telling the truth.""   president bush, apparently worried about the fact that the american economy has lost almost 3 million jobs since he took office, promised to appoint a ""manufacturing czar"" who will watch out for blue-collar jobs. the labor department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in august, and a new study found that the federal workforce is at its highest level (12.1 million) since the cold war. the census department reported that the number of poor people increased last year by 1.3 million. the federal energy regulatory commission announced a settlement with energy companies that benefited from market manipulation in the california energy crisis two years ago. the companies agreed to pay about $1 million in fines, or about 3 cents for every californian, though the energy scam cost the state $8.9 billion, or $250 per citizen. the environmental protection agency relaxed restrictions on selling land contaminated with pcbs, and an astronomer argued that venus once had a climate similar to earth's, prior to its transformation by the greenhouse effect. a federal appeals court blocked the fcc's new rules expanding the freedom of media monopolies, and jessica lynch, the former army private who was captured by iraqis and became the subject of an elaborate heroic fiction, signed a book deal and reportedly received a $1 million advance. lynch will share the advance with her co-author rick bragg, a former new york times reporter. seattle was considering a tax on espresso.   north koreans danced in the streets holding bunches of flowers to celebrate the reelection of kim jong il as chairman of the national defense commission, his primary office; kim il sung, who has been dead for almost ten years, is still officially the head of state. the bush administration retreated from its position that north korea must simply submit to american demands; one state department source said that the policy shift was accomplished while many of the pentagon officials who have driven the administration's hard-line stance were on vacation. there were rumors of a coup plot in the philippines. the coptic orthodox church of egypt condemned gay marriage. an israeli commission of inquiry concluded that police used excessive force in putting down a riot by israeli arabs three years ago in which 13 people were killed. the commission suggested that the police stop using snipers armed with rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse arab crowds. three israeli f-15 fighter jets piloted by the descendants of holocaust survivors flew over the auschwitz death camp in poland during a memorial service. the auschwitz museum had opposed the flyover, saying that a military display was inappropriate on such an occasion. mahmoud abbas, the palestinian prime minister, resigned, and sheikh ahmed yassin, the spiritual leader of hamas, was injured in an israeli airstrike. a car bomb blew up in a market outside srinagar, kashmir, killing at least six people and wounding dozens. a train was blown up in chechnya. twin sisters in morocco were arrested for plotting a suicide attack. charles bronson died. prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy said that judges are lunatics and are anthropologically different from other people. paul j. hill, a christian who murdered an abortion doctor in pensacola, florida, was executed by lethal injection. hill said that he was looking forward to getting his reward in heaven. christians holding signs wept outside the prison; one sign read ""dead doctors can't kill."" interrogators at camp delta, the american penal colony in guantanamo bay, cuba, were said to be using twinkies and mcdonald's happy meals to make the prisoners talk. britney spears, a pop star, declared her faith in president bush: ""honestly,"" she said, ""i think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that."" a large silo filled with human excrement exploded in the bronx. —roger d. hodge  copyright © 2003 harper's magazine foundation.

       urllink ftaa lite seen as deal-breaker  by steven chase miami — canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the united states and brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the americas agreement could derail the talks under way in miami. a group opposed to the barebones deal — including canada, chile, and mexico — says the 'ftaa lite' salvage proposal washington and brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward.  'this is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to ftaa negotiations in miami said yesterday. the move by washington and brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator ftaa deal, ridiculed as 'ftaa lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the western hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.  it would fall grievously short of the sweeping and comprehensive 'nafta on steroids' goal envisaged in 1994, when preparatory ftaa negotiations first began among all countries in the western hemisphere except cuba. trade watchers are increasingly suspicious that the united states' only aim in miami is to keep talks alive until the meeting ends nov. 21.

       your week in focus by john - december 08 to 14  there is no doubt that you are more serious about your objectives than you have been for some time, heather. yet, on the other hand, you are also a lot more fearful of failing. it seems that you have the choice to have more faith in yourself and to stretch yourself to try new things, or you can instead choose to ignore the opportunities banging on your door, and carry on in the same old way. yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. venus and mercury in your opposite sign of capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better. you need a touch of ecstasy after all that you have been through. and your friends want to see you sing and dance, love and be filled with joy. much of what you will be combating at this time will be the devils within, rather than the circumstances without. the sun conjuncts pluto in sagittarius, which means that a change of rules or a new project may bring a delightful new element into your working week.

'they are not part of our work.' they went to their room and began cleaning and polishing the walls.  all day every day they made those walls as pure and clear as an open sky.  there is a way that leads from all-colors to colorlessness. know that the magnificent variety  of the clouds and the weather comes from the total simplicity of the sun and the moon.  the chinese finished, and they were so happy. they beat the drums in the joy of completion.  the king entered the room, astonished by the gorgeous color and detail.  the greeks then pulled the curtain dividing the rooms. the chinese figures and images shimmeringly reflected on the clear greek walls. they lived there, even more beautifully, and always changing in the light.  the greek art is the sufi way. they don't study books of philosophical thought.  they make their loving clearer and clearer. no wantings, no anger. in that purity they receive and reflect the images of every moment, from here, from the stars, from the void.  they take them in as though they were seeing with the lighted clarity that sees them.  in your light i learn how to love. in your beauty, how to make poems.  you dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes i do, and that sight becomes this art.  drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart.  a voice inside that beats says,   ""i know you are tired,   but come. this is the way.""  are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! they swim the huge fluid freedom.

       urllink hospice of north central florida : why do you want to be a hospice volunteer?  there are two reasons i want to work as a hospice volunteer. first, i feel a deep desire to work in the field of death and dying. i moved to gainesville because i want to pursue education for a future career in hospice. i believe volunteering is an imporant first step for me in defining which direction i will take to do this.  second, i feel i am ready and capable of being a support to people in hospice. i experienced two losses which were eased by hospice in broward county. the hospice workers gave incredible care to both of my grandmothers as they were approaching life's end and the volunteers who were there played a critical role. i will always remember the support one of the volunteers gave to my mother during that time just by being there to talk to her.   to sum it all up, i want to give back. i want to do it with my career and i want to start now.  thank you for asking this question.

       urllink osho zen tarot : moment to moment the past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. one used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist. the only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. that's the only right direction. only such a man can enter into the golden gate. the present is the golden gate. here-now is the golden gate. ...and you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious--no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present. a man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate. experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated. osho the great zen master ta hui chapter 37  commentary:  as this figure moves across the stones, he steps lightly and non-seriously, and at the same time absolutely balanced and alert. behind the swirling, ever-changing waters we can see the shapes of buildings; there appears to be a city in the background. the man is in the marketplace but at the same time outside of it, maintaining his balance and able to watch it from above. this card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans. be available to what comes your way, as it comes. and don't worry if you stumble or fall; just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, have a good laugh, and carry on.

      why does the world seem to be getting more fucked up every week?   urllink harper's weekly review (harpers.org) :  ""six american soldiers, including a general, were facing court martial over the torture and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison, which was famous for its torture chambers under saddam hussein. photographs of the abuse were broadcast on u.s. television; one image depicted a hooded prisoner standing on a box with wires attached to his genitals. other photos showed prisoners masturbating; several showed u.s. soldiers smiling and posing next to their victims. some of the soldiers blamed mercenaries for the abuses; others said that military intelligence was in control of that cellblock. photographs were published of british troops beating an iraqi man and urinating on him; the pictures also showed a soldier striking the man in the genitals with a rifle; the victim's jaw was reportedly broken and his teeth were smashed before he was thrown off the back of a moving truck. president bush condemned the abuse. ""their treatment does not reflect the nature of the american people,"" he said.

       urllink painting over plastic laminate :  ""is there any way to paint over dark-brown plastic-laminate kitchen cabinets? i can't replace or reface them right now, and they're just too dark for the room. i'd appreciate any tips."" - lyndee, via e-mail  john says: if you're looking at ugly laminate, refacing it with not-so-ugly laminate is the best course of action, from the standpoint of durability and ease of care. but if it's paint you want, the answer to your question is yes, as long as the laminate is well-adhered and in good condition. first, i'd wipe down all the surfaces with a solvent such as xylol to get rid of dirt and grease. be sure to don chemical-resistant gloves, wear a respirator, shut off any pilot lights, and kick out the dog - this is powerful stuff. then scuff up all the surfaces with 150-grit sandpaper and wipe them down again with xylol. next, you want a primer that will adhere tenaciously and serve as a good base for paint. the one i use comes from x-i-m, a company that manufactures bonding primers; they have several solvent-based products suitable for your application. i find that the spray-applied primer actually holds better than the brush-on version. allow two or three days for the primer to cure before sanding it lightly with 220-grit paper. then you can apply either a latex or oil-based paint; i prefer oil in kitchens because it gives a smoother finish and is easier to clean.  (john dee, a painting and decorating contractor based in concord, mass., has restored finishes on five this old house projects.)

       urllink warning: nicotine seriously improves health  robin mckie, science editor sunday july 18, 2004 the observer   nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders.  research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.   some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.   'a whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said dr dan mcgehee, a neurobiologist at the university of chicago. 'however, such benefits do not justify smoking. the lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. on the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.'   nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. this effect leads to a person's addiction.   more than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. but smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. 'the assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said mcgehee. 'they are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.'   this point is backed by dr tony george, of yale university. 'smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal nature medicine.   similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.   'either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy parkinson's cells,' said mcgehee. 'either way, the effect is noticeable.'

(about half full). fill the blender with warm water. run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) check that no flakes of paper remain. if there are, blend longer.  3. the next step is to make a mold. the mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. it should be as tight as possible.  4. fill the basin about half way with water. add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) stir the mixture.  5. now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(this is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp.  place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even.  6. slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. if the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. if it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again.  7. when the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub.  8. now comes the tricky part. hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. the wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. if it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. it takes a little practice. you can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.  9. repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess)  10. after you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. they can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. when they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper!
