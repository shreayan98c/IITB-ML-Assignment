      nearly 80 percent of uk central government web sites need to be redesigned before they can be fully accessible to users with disabilities, a report has found.     did you know you can get the e-government digest sent direct to your inbox every week? just email us to get your free copy.   a uk publication called egov monitor weekly has reported that around 800 public sector web sites may need rebuilding to comply with accessibility laws requiring government services to cater for people with disabilities.   the claim is based on details leaked from an internal report carried out by the office of the e-envoy (oee), the cabinet office unit responsible among other things for improving the accessibility and usability of uk government web sites.   the oee report draws upon the findings by the national audit office investigation, which examined the accessibility of 65 central government web sites and concluded that nearly all were potentially excluding users.   egov monitor estimates that to fix the problems, government departments may need to spend at least 10 percent to 15 percent of their total annual budget for web sites. editor ian cuddy told electricnews.net that it was difficult to put a precise figure on the total cost of the redesigns required because the oee has refused to release further details of the audit, but it is expected to run into millions.   the oee has now warned the web design industry that future government contracts will demand that companies deliver web sites that conform to international web accessibility standards. current responsibility for adopting these standards rests with individual government webmasters, not designers, and compliance is not centrally monitored.    urllink electricnews.net:news:uk must redesign e-gov sites: report

       urllink bbc article:    opening hours row at cottage: the cottage was opened as a museum in 1924. a heritage group in stafford say they are angry at plans to cut the opening hours of one of the town's most historic landmarks despite their offers of help. the borough council says izaak walton's cottage, in shallowford, is proving expensive to run. the former home of izaak walton, the author of 1653 fishing book the complete angler, houses a collection dedicated to his life and angling. a report to councillors says that limiting access to the museum to weekends from may to august would save â£17,000. currently the attraction is open on weekday afternoons from april to october. 'few opportunities' but the izaak walton cottage chapter, who have set up a charitable trust to fund the running of the cottage, said they were upset the council had not met them before making the decision. tony bridgett, president of the chapter, said: ""the council threatened to close the cottage 18 months ago and there was a campaign run by the people of stafford and ourselves to keep it open. ""so in some respects we are delighted that it is staying open. ""but it is only going to open from may to the end of august, and only on saturdays and sundays and not bank holidays so members of the public are going to get very few opportunities to visit. ""we have some money available and the council say they haven't got any but they haven't got round to meeting us so we are able to mutually work together."" members of the council's leisure scrutiny committee will debate the plans next week. a spokeswoman for the council said the hours had been revised to take into account when visitors most used the cottage. she said a range of events will continue to be held at the cottage and coach trips, including schools, would still be able to visit during the week.

       urllink google, yahoo face off in suit   google is the darling of the internet and seemingly at the top of its game as it charges toward a public stock offering sometime this summer.  but the mountain view company could be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to its sunnyvale archrival, yahoo, if it loses a little-noticed patent lawsuit unfolding in a san jose courtroom.  the case pits google against overture services, an internet advertising company bought by yahoo last year. overture claims it patented an online bidding system for ads seven months before google introduced a similar system.  patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit said overture's patent claims can't be easily dismissed.  ``i think there is merit based on the breadth of the claims,'' said dave ashby, a patent attorney with the ip strategy group in cupertino. ``i took a look at it and said, `yep, google does that. yep, google does that.' ''  a key ruling in the 2-year-old case -- which could determine whether the two sides settle or forge ahead to a jury trial -- is expected at any time, say patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit.  advertising made up about 95 percent of google's $1 billion in revenue last year. if the company loses the patent suit, it would probably have to pay damages, license technology from yahoo or alter how it manages its ad system.  overture, then known as goto.com, filed its patent in may 1999 for a ``system and method for influencing a position on a search result list.'' the 43-page patent application details a system in which advertisers would be able to bid for better placement of ads in search-engine results and manage their accounts through a web browser.  the u.s. patent office awarded the patent july 31, 2001.  in february 2002, google introduced its adwords program -- a system that would eventually help reshape internet advertising and legitimize search engines as a viable business. with adwords, advertisers bid for the right to certain keywords. when a google user types in that keyword as part of a search, the advertiser's pitch shows up near the results.  a tour operator in hawaii, for example, might buy the terms ``hawaii,'' ``vacation,'' ``volcano'' and ``beach,'' and its ads will appear next to google search results for those terms. advertisers bid against one another for keywords, with higher bidders getting better ad placement.  in its suit, filed in april 2002, overture says google is ``willfully'' and ``directly infringing'' on its patent. the company is seeking triple damages.  google, which is in a mandated ``quiet period'' leading up to its ipo, declined to comment on the suit, as did attorneys representing both companies.  but in court documents, the company denies overture's allegations. among other things, google is claiming that overture was using its advertising system for more than a year before it filed for its patent. patent law gives people a year to file patents after inventing something; a late filing automatically invalidates the patent.  patent attorneys who have reviewed court documents have mixed views on overture's chances of prevailing.  mitchell rosenfeld, a patent attorney with capstone law group in san mateo, said google has submitted substantial evidence to show that overture missed the one-year deadline.  rosenfeld said a key issue in the case could end up being whether overture was testing its technology or using a finished product.  on the other hand, overture needs only to prove that google infringed on one of the 67 claims in its patent. also, overture's patent application appears to have been well-researched by both the company and the patent office, said bruce sunstein of bromberg & sunstein in boston.  ``this is going to be a patent that is relatively difficult to knock out,'' sunstein said.  since late march, u.s. district judge jeffrey white, a former patent attorney, has been analyzing the scope and meaning of overture's patent, poring over each word and studying terminology such as ``database'' and ``search result list.'' it's a crucial step before a jury can be asked to decide whether a company has infringed on a patent. a ruling could come any day.  known as ``markman'' rulings, these decisions are often tipping points in patent cases, said patent attorney john ferrell, co-founder of carr & ferrell in palo alto.  if the judge does not agree with one side's interpretation of the patent language, it will often push to settle the suit, he said.  the case is especially intriguing now that internet search engines have become big business. when the suit was filed two years ago, overture was suing an up-and-coming search engine with an unproven business model.  today, google is considered the king of internet search. and overture's stature increased when yahoo acquired the company for $1.83 billion in stock and cash, incorporating its advertising technology and patents into its services.  ``it's one of those things that two or three years ago wouldn't have been an issue,'' said andy beal, vice president of search marketing for websourced. ``but it just goes to show you how big search is.''  about half of all patent verdicts are overturned on appeal. and the stakes are high. ultimately, the two sides will have to weigh the costs of a prolonged legal fight -- attorney bills in a case like this could reach $1 million a year -- against the possibility of losing.  ``my observation is that there is this big lawsuit between two enormous players,'' ashby said, ``and no one is paying attention to it.''
