      ""for the love of god is broader that the measure of the mind &nbsp;and the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind."" &nbsp;-&nbsp;our lady of mount carmel hymn  michael was the first openly gay man that i met in life. every day after world literature we would walk to the college cafeteria and eat lunch together, sometimes studying for a test, but mostly we discussed his sexuality and his faith. i was curious about him, about how he could be both gay and christian. i grew up in a southern baptist tradition that labeled homosexuals as deviants who were out to corrupt godde-fearing people. listening and learning about life through the eyes of scared adults, anything and everything can be painted as black or white, right or wrong, and good or evil. when you are a child, it is hard to see the that the world is comprised of multiple shades of grey. therefore, it is easy, too easy, to judge others for their differences, because you are not yet comfortable in your own skin.  at a time when i was advocating at the top of my lungs against institutionalized christianity, michael was advocating in favor of the church. it baffled me that he did not consider it a paradox, a contradiction, or an oxy-moron to be a gay man and a christian. i did not understand how he could support and participate in an institution that stated that godde hated him for who he loved. michael told me that he believed that godde is merciful, kind, and loving, rather than a vindictive deity that is pissed at the world. ""sometimes the people in charge of the religion,"" he said, ""get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message. the message of godde, of christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man."" a few weeks later, michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me. he told me that he was hiv positive. i remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and i was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease. now, i realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.  i never saw michael after that semester. i tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and i have moments when i wonder if he is even still walking among us. i am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love. in light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, i have thought about my friendship with michael more and more and i often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to godde. to me it is clear that godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings. godde does not discriminate and i am very proud of the episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining gene robinson. i will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision. it is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions. to the individuals that are quick to suggest that gene robinson will be punished by godde for his relationship with a man, may i remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin. instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man. open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you.

      a couple of years ago, i wrote a short story entitled, ""faith is a funny thing."" i wrote this story at a time in my life when my quest for spiritual direction was beginning to resemble a fruitless search for a needle in a haystack. in the story, a young woman find solace in a dusty cathedral, the very institution that she spent years denouncing. it was a piece that would foreshadow my return to the church in the years to come.  i was a spiritual pilgrim for the span of a decade, researching and practicing a variety of religions. i attended a service at a jewish synagogue, read thich nhat hanh's  living buddha, living christ , held a full moon ritual in my living room, and attended catholic mass on a sunday afternoon. in yann martel's  the life of pi , the main character, pi, practices a multiplicity of religions and sees no conflict in his syncretism. halfway through the book, pi and his family are walking through town and are approached by the leaders of the local temple, church, and mosque. each leader tells pi that he must chose a religion to practice. he can be a devout hindu, christian, or muslim, but he can not practice all three faiths at the same time. pi remarks that all he wants to do is love god. the church leaders are speechless at the simplicity of that statement.  i love to tell people the story of my return to the church. i tell them that i am a christian because of a conversation that i had with a pagan. my good friend, loria, listened to me rant on and on about my spiritual crisis until finally she told me that there was no shame in being christian. she reminded me that there are a lot of interpretations of what it means to be a christian, that jesus was a profound teacher and prophet, and that a great deal of beauty remains in the christian tradition. you just have to find a community that you feel comfortable attending. i did.  i am an episcopalian. i am an open-minded, syncretic, goddess-loving, liberal, celtic christian-buddhist. i believe that jesus was sent to the earth to teach and inspire humankind. i believe that godde is both masculine and feminine and that he/she resides in every single heart that beats on this planet. i am addicted to sufi poetry, buddhist philosophy, and celtic rituals. religion, faith, is not about the rules, but what road the heart travels. if our motive in life is to love godde, regardless of the form that being/spirit takes, then does it really matter how we go about expressing that love? my answer is no, it does not matter. rituals, words, and theology are wonderful things until they begin to place limitations on a person's soul. in the end, what matters the most is how that person uses their faith in the world. their actions towards other human beings are a reflection of their interpretation of godde.  the rest is just ashes and dust.

       i believe in eating. i think women especially have this fear of eating, and i think there is a whole euphoric plane you can rise to when you have a good meal. you sit down and with every bite you honestly just say thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(tori amos)  i was eight years old when i went on my first diet. i have this memory of standing on the scales in the pediatrician's office and hearing the doctor tell my mother that i was fat. as an adult, i look at pictures taken of me during that time and i often wonder what the doctor was thinking. i looked like a healthy, active eight year old girl. my mother immediately put me on a diet. she gave my grandmother the strictest orders not to let me eat anything other than cantaloupe for a snack. nan took pity on me after the second week of scarfing down cantaloupe; she gave me cookies and ate the fruit herself. i have not eaten cantaloupe since that summer.  my weight haunts me. it speaks to me, nit-picks me in the guise of voices from the past; lance crane telling our fifth grade classmates that there would be no more ice cream left once i went through the serving line, the constant pressure of being stick thin in high school, and my best guy friend from college telling me that men did not like girls with guts and if i wanted a boyfriend then i would have to lose weight, because no guy would want me otherwise. these are the things that i think about when i am in the presence of a man, even if that man is my lover. i know that it does not do well to dwell on the past, but when you spend your life hearing that you are less because you are more, it is hard to believe that beauty resides within your body.  i do not blame my mother for her obsession with my weight. it seems that she too was contantly struggling with her self-esteem in that realm. in her mind big was a simple translation for ugly and so i can not hold her actions against her, because she was suffering from the same societal ideals of beauty. she was struggling to feel beautiful and she wanted me to not have that struggle. it amazes me how many beautiful women, who i am surrounded by on a daily basis, think that they are hiddeous. i read my livejournal, talk to my co-workers, listen to my friends; all of them think that they are less than wonderful, because this world, this culture tells them that they are worthless unless they have sarah jessica parker's body, a body that has no curves, very little cleavage, and is nothing but skin drawn taunt over bone. how is that beautiful?  i stand in front of the mirror naked and i like what i see. i walk around my apartment without clothes, because i am, finally, learning to be comfortable in my own skin. it has nothing to do with being sexy, although if you ask me i will tell you that i am sexy, and everything to do with feeling at ease with the woman that i have become. yes, i want to lose a few more pounds, for health reasons. next week, i am going back to the pool and swimming laps, because i miss the feel of the water between my thighs and the burning in my lungs when i am holding my breathe. i want to, once again, be addicted to the feel of gliding through the water. i used to swim two miles non-stop, the equivalent of 72 laps in an olympic-size pool, and i want that to happen again.  until then, i will continue to stand in front of the mirror and celebrate my hips that could bring children into this world with great ease, my breasts that are full and lovely and tinted at the tips with a shade of pink, and my back, which is smooth and, in my opinion, flawless. i am a work of art, because godde made me. as women, we must learn to embrace ourselves and not fall victim to the societal contructs of beauty. if society had its way, i would be the size of my letter-opener, quiet, docile, and submissive.  no. fucking. thank you.

       this one is for you, dad.   i want to talk about censorship. i want to talk about what happens when you get home after a hard day and find that you father has left a message on your machine, telling you that he read your website and that he thinks that using the ""f-word"" to make a point is very inappropriate. if it were any other person, i would launch into a lecture about my right to free speech, free assembly, and the academic concept of language reclamation. however, when it is with my father, confrontation seems more difficult, because i was daddy's little girl long before i was a feminist.  when you plant your feet, heart, mind, and soul under the banner of feminism, loving men reaches a level of frustration that is unparallel to any other experience. there are a great number of men who continue to identify feminism as an anti-male campaign. this is a lie. the complexity with feminism and my relationship with my father is that it is difficult to play out simultaneous roles. i can no longer play the role of dutiful daughter, because the woman inside me is demanding justice. i can no longer pretend that my father is a paragon of perfection, because humans are flawed. for any woman who once thought that her father walked on water, it is a hard lesson to learn when you discover that you are a disappointment to the man who gave you life.  i am sorry that i disappointed you, dad. i am sorry that you think there is hypocrisy in my lifestyle because i use vulgar language and then call myself a christian, but i will not censor myself for anyone, especially not for you. you were the person who taught me to be strong, to never settle, to always be true to myself, and to believe that i could do anything that i put my mind to. now, you are telling me that the way that i conduct myself is inappropriate and even though you do not verbalize it, the insinuation in your message is this;  the man who i adore most in the world is ashamed of me.   that is a bitter pill to swallow, even for the most ardent feminist. i still remember what it felt like to be the pride and joy in your life and thought it sounds selfish -even to my own ears- it hurts to even consider the possibility that those feelings are no longer present in your heart when you think of me.

      sunday evening, i went to church for the first time since my confirmation in june. it is pathetic and sad, how distracted i became this past summer. lust overcame my heart and i pulled away from godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin. yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, i found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft. godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when i felt him slip through my fingers. godde continues to hold me together as i am writing these words.  it felt like coming home when i received communion. i could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul. when i tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church. when i drank the wine, i could feel the blood of christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead. catholics believe that the eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of christ. episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.  in my opinion, christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament. long before there were numerous denominations, the early christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine. they risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act. the eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of christ, binds christians to one another.  growing up in a southern baptist tradition, i received communion during two services a year, christmas and easter. i never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when i started attending services at the episcopal church, i thought it strange that episcopalians received the eucharist every single sunday without fail. now, i can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before i go out into the world. it is the ultimate business card,  please, take our savior with you. his body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you . it is an incredible gift.  this is the reason that i am a christian. the eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with gene was falling apart. i know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart. the eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change. it is an integral part of the faith. it is what brings christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.  it is a blessing. it is home.

      i believe in things that i cannot see with my eyes. i hold stock, importance and prominence, in the rest of the senses; touch, taste, hear, and smell. yesterday, i celebrated the birth of a miraculous man. i cannot prove that he was the son of godde, but i feel that particular truth down in the depths of my bones. however, he is not the only truth in which i believe nor does my belief in him negate or make impossible the existence of other esteemable tenants.  i consider myself a celtic-christo-episco-pagan, who follows the teachings of jesus and pays homage to the goddess. i believe in the existence of faeries, santa claus, elves, unicorns; all forms of magic that can only be found by paying attention, by listening to that child-like voice that lives inside of me, a voice that has the potential to disappear if we, human beings, do not guard it with care and love. i hold the words of buddha close to my heart and i have a penchant for islamic spiritual poetry. i follow the religious path of the ancient celtic church. i use my rosary for prayer and meditation.  i believe that evil exists, but i also believe in the overwhelming nature of good, of godde. godde speaks to every man and woman, through every race, religion, and creed. godde is not reserved for one nation or one brand of theology, but embraces and can be embraced by all who walk this planet. beauty, happiness and fulfillment, can be found in every tradition.  regardless of your path, i wish you a blessed christmas and a happy new year.

      there are some occasions for which hallmark has no appropriate card to give to another human being. there is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with hiv and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.  there is no card for my friend, and co-worker, nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease. last week, i discovered that her doctor found four tumors in nancy's brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim. i am struggling with the injustice of this revelation. it is times like these that cause me to question godde's purpose for people. is this kind of action the definition of mercy? is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner? how does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?  sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile. there are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.  this is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope. the most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it.
