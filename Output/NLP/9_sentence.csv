      i just spent some time playing with the beta version of  urllink atmosphere , adobe's new 3d environment software, and thought i'd give a couple of quick impressions.    i've always been interested in vr and spent quite a bit of time working in vrml, but i think the inherant problem with vrml was that not enough attention had been given to community.  you could build all these really cool places but people couldn't interact in them.  you also couldn't easily move from one 3d environment to another without going back and forth between 2d web pages.  i was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with vrml (anybody remember terra vista?) but it didn't as far as we would have liked.  atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  it's not the first product to do so, but maybe adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.

      now in mindjack, a review of the  urllink xircom wireless lan module  for palm m500 handhelds.  a subject that only cory doctorow could make this interesting.   four or five years ago, i had a sea-change in my computing experience. one day, i realized that i had started to view any computer not connected to the internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong.    this feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day i got my first ibook and airport base station. if you've used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what i'm talking about -- snatching the internet out of the very air is an experience you won't go back from willingly (another one is tivo -- i've stopped watching tv in hotel rooms because i can't choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). just as tivo ruined me for dumb tv, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.    and it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn't just a technology, it's a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. if you're in a major city, chances are you'll find one before you go a block. forget 3g and blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.

       urllink mindjack interviews warren ellis!     so why aren't you reading comics these days?  really, it doesn't seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. i want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. the western medium has cycles, and it's currently in a creative downturn. that doesn't mean there isn't excellent work being done. that simply means there's not much of it. and, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. not many comics reflect the fact that i live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that i don't own a pair of superman underpants.

      i'm pleased to announce that vrml creator and all-around visionary mark pesce has joined mindjack's ever-growing stable of writers.  his first article,   urllink redefining television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.  here's a snippet:   in the earliest days of television, writers like george orwell in  1984  and ray bradbury in  fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. and, if any of you occasionally watch fox news, you can see they weren't that far off the mark. but here's the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. actually, they've already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.  to understand why, we need to go back to first principles. what is television? here's a functional definition:   television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.   this definition applies to the golden age of television, and to the present era. yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.
