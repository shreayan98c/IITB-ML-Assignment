      the next city in the current series is allahabad. this city lies on the confluence of the three rivers the ganges, the yamuna and the saraswati. however, if you pick up the atlas, you'll see that there are only two rivers. what about the  third  river? well! it is mythological. yes that's right it's mythological. it is reputed that the river saraswati flowed there and due to some event (i don't remember what) it went underground out of shame. the rivers in india have been personified, that's how the shame factor comes into the picture.   anyway back to the city, a nice city to live in. i did my class sixth and seventh here in different schools, namely the st joseph's college and the kendriya vidyalaya, manauri. after this city i've always studied in kendriya vidyalayas(central schools in hindi). amazingly there is nothing very remarkable about this city as far as modern times go. but this city is steeped in indian mythology. lord ram is said to have been here during his 14 years of forced exile. another feature of this place, the roots of a banyan tree which gives of leaves(you've got to see it to believe it), the very same banyan tree is said to be several millenia old and the british even tried to set it afire (out of plain old malice)so that we'd lose this part of our heritage, but this tree survived and is said to be one of the largest trees in india.  there is also a tunnel which is said to go all the way from allahabad to delhi. people have tried to follow this tunnel but it ends due to a rockfall some distance inside. i was here during the infamous babri masjid (mosque) demolition. that was one shameful aspect of india's modern history, when a bunch of hooligans decided to break down the mosque. there was a lot of tension because of the demolition and the army had to do flag marches and the like in certain localities to calm things down a bit. i was also here during the infamous anti mandal commision riots. the riots took place because of the provision for reservation for the backward classes in the government jobs and other government owned and operated institutions. a lot of heartburn took place in this country because of that one man who was responsible for this. the amazing part is that man is alive and hopes to enter active politics again. (to dispel any confusion it was not mr mandal, but prime minister vp singh who actually implemented the commision report and is thus reviled for the reason).  i probably will never want to come back here again, simply because there is nothing to come back to.

      the next place i'm writing about is wellington, no it is not the wellington you're thinking of. this wellington is in the southern indian state of tamil nadu, my father was here for his staff college course at the defence services staff college. this place too served as a jump of point visit several southern indian cities like mysore, chennai (madras) and the like. the hill station oooty is just a stones throw away from here. there are two ways to get to wellington. one is to take a bus from the nearest railhead coimbatore, and the other is to take the toy train, just joking, it's actually a metre gauge train which has a third rail in between the two tracks to provide traction while climbing the steep hill sides. again a very picturesque location. i did class 1 and half of class 2 here, we had stayed here for only 1 year. i studied in a school called the holy angels. the year of stay 1985.   last words: a very sleepy town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home, i could live here, in 50 years time

      the first place i'm writing about is a place called yol camp, this town is based on a hillside in the kangra district in the state of himachal pradesh. this place is near dhramsala, which more famous due to the the tibetan government in exile. i've lived in this town twice, the first time when iwas doing kindergarten, and then more recently in class 8th and 9th. i remember a few things from my first stay. i used to go to a school called the sacred heart school, which is about 8 km away from yol. and the other time i studied in kendriya vidalaya (central school).   this place has a lot of temples around it. this place also served as a jump of point to visit other cities and towns in north india, like pathankot, jammu, vaishno devi(a very big pilgrimage spot). a very picturesque locale. as the whole town is based on the hillside, and the roads up the hill are inclined at a 70 degree angle, and is wont to happen, a lot of accidents take place.   last words: a very sleepy town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home (let me otta here)

      from the west of the country i went all the way to the north east. the next city i lived in was guahati. this city is the largest in the entire north eastern part of india. it has a very famous temple called the kamakhya which has been filthly maintained. also famous in this region is the assam silk saree, which was exported by my mother to all her relatives all over the country and abroad. we went to several places in assam and the neighbouring states. some of the places we went to were cherapunji(highest rainfall in the world). we also went to the kaziranga national park, famous for the one horned rhino. generally an okay city if you can put up with the people who cannot speak english or hindi properly and not to mention the fact, that they invariably mispronounce your name. an interesting superstition is that  you cannot leave assam unless you have crossed the bramhaputra at least seven times. if you do leave before you have done so, you are destined to come back. i don't think i want to go back to this place again simply because there is nothing to go back to or for.

      some months ago, when i was with bccl, (the publisher of the times of india and he economic times), i had a conversation with cto of the group internet company, times internet limited. who asked me to put down some thoughts on how i see things on the internet shaping up. while i did put down those thoughts, i never actually sent it to him, the file was lying around till i came across it a couple of days back.  here is a rewrite of what i initially penned down (typed up?).   a lot of rambling about nothing in particular.    the positioning of a product or service is more and more targeted to more and more specific audiences? case in point are the bmw and mercedes, both are from fine german engineering pedigree, both are premium luxury cars. however the buyers of the two will probably as different as two people can be. the former will be bought by a person who will drive the car himself and the latter probably by someone who has a chauffer (yes, i know mercedes also makes sports cars… this is the general perception that i expressed here). such a huge differentiation in mindset is what branding is all about. this trend is seen in media as well. the rise of niche publications in developed economies such as the us and uk is illustrative of this.   any media would broadly undergo the distinct phases of consolidation in the growth phase and then  fragmentation once the medium matures. the internet is perhaps one medium which fragmented even before it matured. this is perhaps explained by the global reach of the media and the fact that ideas can be easily replicated across geographical & political boundaries; i.e. something that works in america, will almost certainly not work in india, simply because the maturity of the american market is of a different order of magnitude. to illustrate this point further the existence and flourishing of sites like epinions.com (in the american context) and the apparent non-starter of the indian equivalent mouthshut.com which are sources of information.  or price comparison sites like mysimon.com which as far as i know has no comparable indian site.   with this brief background, it would be instrumental to see the whole internet game in a different perspective . the internet tends to promote the formation of groups of people with very specific interests. a sort of mother of all niche publications, which you can talk back to and what’s more it talks back to you and allows you to communicate with your peer group.   while the bennet philosophy has been to be an aggregator of audiences by subsidizing the price the audience pays to retrieve content and then retrieving profit from the purchasing those audiences. this can prove counter productive as far as the internet goes, as the internet has people who are used to getting content for free and are likely to freeload. on the other hand the audience which does pay to retrieve the content would then be most prized and wanted by an advertiser, if nothing to prove non frivolousness of their transaction with us. the idea would be to convince the mass populace that information is of value. the easiest way to ensure that is to look for focused verticals in the information segment. the first one that comes to mind is economictimes.com or more accurately perhaps the work of etig.   the biggest problem that one can make out is how will people pay for it online. multimodal payment mechansims are already in use by the indiatimes family of websites. virtual currency of some kind can perhaps be also created for this purpose.   what about the business we are in?    content can take several forms, one of the forms could be that of blogs (such as the one you are reading right now). blogs are the latest rage in america, now spreading to other parts of the world. blogs are nothing but a personal running commentary on the world in general and sometimes specific to a topic.   another form could be in the form of reviews. reviews can be on any topic, from the palces to party & eat out in delhi to where to find the best shoes in chandini chowk. ineractivity which needs to be the cornerstone of such an offering. such content may well be in the form of a blog.   traditional content in the form of newspapers, tv, radio will definitely migrate in one form or the other to the web. evolution of devices like the microsoft tablet pc or the handspring treo are definitely a step in that direction.   in that respect standardisation under one name a la indiatimes.com is probably the biggest single mistake being undertaken by us and many others across the world. this conclusion is based on our initial premise that internet promotes the formation of specific focus groups. by definition these focus groups would be unlikey to turn to a general interest portal to get their kicks so to speak. the creation of multiple brands would be a better branding and strategic idea, having a ghoomnahai.com rather than having something like indiatimes travel. this gives an identity to the content and makes it more valued by its consumers.   the above, when seen in the overall context of evolution of media, is a perfectly logical sequence of events. growing media consolidates, and then fragments. during the growth phase it is perfectly acceptable to have a single brand name, but the moment the medium matures (maybe in the context of the limited audience it gathers in the indian scenario)   show me the money!!!   whether people will pay to read (& someday in the future see) such content is debatable. the likes of al ries would have us believe that advertising will never work on the internet (which is something i disagree with strongly). so what will happen? will the internet become a subversive medium which will undermine modern society as we know it. a sort of a no man’s land where no content will be paid for? products and services being the only ones able to draw any sort of revenue?   “the truth” as the immortal words form ‘x files’ go “is out there..”.  my personal suspicion is that heavily prized content a la nyt or wsj will not only be paid for, but will also attract significant advertising revenues. for the rest, creation of strong niches will allow them to do the same…   ps: don't hesitate to comment...

      the festival of lights  this is one of the oldest hindu festivals occuring in the month of kartik, which commemorates the return of rama to ayodhya after an exile of 14 years. it also marks the beginning of the new year and is celebrated with the lighting of lamps. diwali or deepawali, literally 'an array of lamps', is the festival of lights and is celebrated on the darkest night of kartik. it is perhaps the most important festival in india. originally a hindu festival, it has now crossed the bounds of religion and is celebrated by all in india with fervor and gaiety. this day is a public holiday all over india.  twinkling oil lamps or diyas light up every home and firework displays are common all across the country. the goddess lakshmi (consort of vishnu), who is the symbol of wealth and prosperity, is also worshipped on this day. this festive occasion also marks the beginning of the hindu new year and lord ganesha, the elephant-headed god, the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom, is also worshipped in most hindu homes on this day.  another view is that deepawali is meant to celebrate the destruction of the arrogant tyrant bali at the hands of vishnu when the latter appeared in his vamana (dwarf) avatar. the occasion of deepawali sees the spring-cleaning and white-washing of houses; decorative designs or rangolis are painted on floors and walls. new clothes are bought and family members and relatives gather together to offer prayers, distribute sweets and to light up their homes.   diwali is also perhaps the oldest festival still celebrated today and is mentioned in the ramayana. the celebrations include the lighting of lamps and candles, and the bursting of crackers (fireworks). friends and neighbours exchange special sweets. people buy new clothes and in fact, in certain communities, it is absolutely essential to wear new clothes on this day.  diwali in india is equivalent to christmas in the west. therefore it is also the time when people get the festival bonus to their salaries. it marks the beginning of the new year for a large majority of hindus, especially the trader community.  preparations for the festival begin many days prior to diwali. it is time for a thorough cleaning of the house, for the belief is that lakshmi will enter clean and nicely decorated houses. the scientific reason is that the monsoon is a time for insects and fungus to breed.with the end of the monsoon, homes need to be cleaned and painted, and belongings aired and dried before the onset of winter. the festival itself extends over about a week even though the most important day is the new moonday.  in east bihar and northern india, two days before diwali is celebrated as dhanteras in honour of dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. he is believed to have emerged with a pot of amrita during the samudra manthan. people bathe early in the morning and observe a fast, which is broken only after sunset with sweetmeats, puri and other delicacies. on dhanteras, new kitchen utensils are bought and kept at the place of worship. the buying of utensils, according to one theory, relates to the myth of dhanvantari emerging from the ocean with a pot in his hand. since he is also the physician of the gods, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to this festival. the day before diwali is celebratedas choti diwali or 'small diwali'. it is diwali on a smaller scale, with fewer lights lit and fewer crackers burst.  the morning after choti diwali, the women of the house make beautiful, coloured rangoli in the doorway and courtyard. tiny footprints made out of rice paste are a special feature of the rangolis made for diwali. they signify the footprints of lakshmi, as she enters the house. in hindu homes, diwali celebrations involve a ritual puja to lakshmi and also to rama in the evening. songs in honour of the gods are sung and arati is performed. oil or ghee diyas are also lit. the gods are offered kheel, batashe and khilone and various sweetmeats. after the puja, the diyas are placed in and around the house: in the doorway, near the tulasi plant, the backyard, every room and the back and front gates. after this, crackers are burst, and people meet friends and neighbours to exchange good wishes and sweets. since diwali falls on the new moon night, lamps are lit to brighten this moonless night. according to a myth, lakshmi will not enter a dark house. the lamps also welcome home the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to visit on this auspicious night. in addition, the light frightens away any evil spirit that might be wandering about near the house on this night. in orissa, lamps are lit to light up the dark path that the spirits of ancestors take back to heaven. in modern times, ghee diyas have been replaced by wax candles and coloured electric bulbs. in many areas, there is a competition of sorts among neighbours as everyone tries to have the brightest lights. the origin of diwali can be traced back to ancient india, when it was probably an important harvesting season. it was thus extremely important to the largely pastoral vaishya community. their granaries were full, and the weather was good, at the end of the long monsoon and before the arduous winter. it was therefore a good time to celebrate. the vaishya community began their new year with this happy occassion, after paying their debts and clearing their ledgers. as the religion developed, various mythological stories and explanations were attributedto this festival to give it religious sanction.  however today, this historical explanation is all but lost among the many stories and folklore linked with the origin of the festival. according to the most popular one, diwali is celebrated in honour of rama, his consort sita and brother lakshmana, returning to their kingdom ayodhya after a 14-year exile.to celebrate this event, people at ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps. the illuminations also symbolise the removal of spiritual darkness and the onset of happiness and prosperity.    according to another belief, it is on this day that lakshmi emerged from the ocean during the samudra manthan .lakshmi puja commemorates her birth and therefore forms a major part of diwali celebrations. being associated with the goddess of wealth and fortune, diwali is specially important to the vaishya   community. most tradesmen close their old ledgers and dealings and start afresh with new ledgers after diwali. this day, with its emphasis on money, is also considered lucky for gambling. giving social sanction to a vice, a popular saying states that one who does not gamble on this day will beborn a donkey in his next birth. casinos and local gambling houses do brisk business during the diwali week. in most homes, people invite their friends and relatives over to play cards.   another reason for the celebration of diwali is that it marks the killing of the evil narkasura at the hands of krishna naraka is believed to have abducted 16,000 women. krishna killed him and rescued these women whom he later married. naraka is the personification of hell and is believed to be the monsoon during which all activities come to a standstill.   though diwali is equally important in the south and the north, the celebrations are markedly different. in south india, the story widely associated with diwali is that of narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of vishnu. according to a legend, hiranyakshipu was an evil demon king. he was unjust and cruel to his people. however, he was almost invincible, having extracted a boon from brahma that he would be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night. when his atrocities became unbearable, the gods sought vishnu's help. assuming his fifth incarnation of narasimha, the man-lion,vishnu killed hiranyakshipu with his claws in the courtyard just before day break, hence steering clear of the boundaries of the boon. for this reason in the south, people light diyas in their houses on the day preceding diwali. the next day begins early. first is the ritual bath, which begins with an oil massage of the hair and body. this is absolutely essential on this day. its importance probably refers to cleaning oneself thoroughly after the monsoon months. after bathing, people receive new clothes and gifts from their elders, which they are expected to wear. the family then prays to vishnu for its well-being and prosperity. after the prayers start the main celebrations which, as in the north, consist of bursting crackers and lighting candles.at day break, all celebrations end.people then visit friends and relatives and exchange sweets.   references to the word 'atishbaji' or'crackers' are found even in ancient literature. the bursting of crackers is today the most important and eagerly-awaited part of the diwali celebrations. according to one belief, the sound that resounds throughout the universe makes all aware of the great homecoming of rama. another belief is that the crackers are an indication ofthe joy of the people living on the earth, making the gods aware of their plentiful state. still another possible reason has a more scientific basis: the fumes produced by the crackers kill a lot of insects, found in plenty after the rains. the use of high-tech bomb crackers is fairly recent. at times, diwali celebrations get ugly, especially in the metropolitan cities. in new delhi, people start bursting crackers in the evening and this continues till the early hours ofthe morning. as a result, the city is engulfed in toxic fumes and smoke for almost 10 hours. another problem with crackers is that their manufacture is usually unregulated. as a result, the manufacturing units are unsafe and the material used is inflammable and toxic.every year, many units are destroyed inaccidental fires, resulting in the death of those employed there.   kerala is probably the only state in india where even hindus do not celebrate diwali. the major festival there is onam. in west bengal, kali puja is performed on diwali as it is believed that on this day kali killed the wicked raktavija. being one of the main festivals of the trader community, markets are gaily decorated and lit up. many safety measures and precautions are telecast on television and radio, especially for children. the fire departments are kept on the alert, and the municipal corporations of bigger cities also organise buckets and tankers of water at strategic locations. the second day after diwali is celebrated as bhai duja when sisters apply tilak to their brothers and pray for their long and happy life. in all likelihood, this ritual was originally intended only for married women. since they celebrated diwali with their in-laws, this festival allowed them to come to their parents' home during this auspicious time. they got some time to meet the family and to rest after the hectic activity of the preceding week.and it gave their parents an opportunity to give them gifts, an opportunity they did not often get. nowadays however, among many communities bhai duja is observed by both married and unmarried sisters.   urllink http://webonautics.com/ethnicindia/festivals/diwali.html

      smite on...    urllink god considers smiting bible pirates   vatican city - god did not rule out smiting as a final measure against those who share his most famous work, the bible, on the internet. this marks the first time a deity has spoken on it-related questions since steve jobs was temporarily enlightened when touching the one true imac some years ago.  authorized version? citing misuse of his word, misquotation, and putting hardworking bible printers out of work, god said he would now start hunting bible pirating around the globe. 'i have to defend both my world-famous brand - the bible and its distinctive likenesses - and the livelihood of those who create and distribute legal copies of it. sure, they live not by bread alone, but website hits - someone else's website mind you - don't pay the bills for these folks.' since large portions of the bible are many centuries old, many people believe the work to be in the public domain. not so, said god. 'look, most copyright laws are based on something like the author's lifetime plus, let's say, 15 years. news flash: i'm still here.' ' i am a jealous god,' he said, 'but i am by no means unreasonable. if the person will stop distributing my copyrighted materials, there will be no further consequences. like i've said before: hate pirating, love the pirate.'

       urllink neowin  forums has a story that hotmail is to upgrade space. 250 mb for free users and 2 gb for paid users. of course i would still not use it because of the tons of spam that pours into hotmail accounts

      friends, pakistanis and wellwishers, lend me your ears. (actually eyeballs) :).  after weeks of what can only be termed as medieval torture i.e. pricks, boiling water, melted wax, electrocution, fingers bent thisway and that, i've recovered to a state which can be termed as normal as far as civilised humans go. i was finally able ride a bike (yes the very same one, that was smashed in my unfortunate close acquaintance with a truck on the picturesque route to mussorie) as of yesterday. it was limited to a an agonisingly short 10 minutes, but till more strength returns that will have to do. physiotherapy will continue for the next few months, but if all goes well, i should be back in delhi on the first of august and rejoin on the 2nd. of course i have to hunt for a physiotherapist that suits my timings, but that is a small matter...  before you say that should be the last joyride across the country, i'm thinking of driving back to delhi on the bike... still have to convince a few people though... :)  cheerio  chirag

      what the...  urllink you are blogging my view...   the first time i heard the term “blogging”, the first thing that came to mind was two men in kerela on a gogonet tree and one saying to the other, “you are blogging my view”. however, now this means something totally different to me. blogging my view, now means that after reading your blog, my views are changing. how many of us are actually willing to let go of our opinions and accept new ones as we just read or heard something different from the views we so strongly believed in all this while. this is like writing a personal diary for everyone to read. i always thought about those who write a diary. i thought those were the people so desperate that someone  picks up their diary and reads it and saves them. it was a cry for help for those poor recluses and introverts. and then they made this rule, thou shall not read a personal diary. this obviously attracted more people to their diaries. so am i turning into a hopeless recluse?? i hope not. i do tend to drift away, but i think it gives you a chance to increase the scope of your discussion. anyways...
