      every day should be a half day.  took the afternoon off to hit the dentist, and while i was out i managed to get my oil changed, too.  remember that business with my car dealership this winter?  well, consider this the epilogue.  the friendly fellas at the valvoline instant oil change on snelling were nice enough to notice that my dipstick was broken, and the metal piece was too far down in its little dipstick tube to pull out.  looks like i'm going to need a magnet.   damn you, kline nissan, daaaaaaammmnnn yooouuuu....   today i let my boss know that i've submitted my corps application.  the news has been greeted by everyone in the company with a level of enthusiasm that really floors me.     the back deck has finally been cleared off by the construction company working on the place.  this company, for anyone who's interested, consists mainly of one guy who spends his days cursing at his crew of spanish-speaking laborers.  construction of my deck began around the time nixon was getting out of office.

      i'm still not making any headway with my family.  in fact, i think mom has been rallying the troops (aka aunts and uncles) against me.  meanwhile, my friends have been really supportive of the idea.  thanks, all.  it's frustrating, you know?  here, i want to get out into the world, have a pinch of adventure, and maybe help some people out in the process, and i'm earning the resentment of the entire freakin' family because of this.  i can only hope that, over time, cooler heads will prevail.  there's now a nationwide girlfriend hunt on for yours truly (hell, with mom's mexico ties, this shit could go international), because, obviously, the cure for all this foolishness is for me to get laid.  oh, and i should buy myself something nice.  problem solved.  life is so sad.  had a spot of sunday night insomnia, fueled mostly by my discussions with the parents yesterday.  thankfully, jack daniels helped me out with that.  whoever is in charge of late night sunday programming should be shot.  sunday night insomnia is not an uncommon phenomenon, and tv needs to be there for people in their hour(s) of need!  jerks.

       about schmidt  this afternoon.  pretty good.  a little vexed by the ending.  i think i'm getting too lazy to interpret ambiguity.  finished up most of my application today, essay questions and all.  all that remains is to inform my references of their reference status... and that could very well mean letting my company know that i'm planning to leave in 6 mos. to a year.  i'm not sure how they'll react, but i'm not all that concerned, either.  good people there, certainly, but i am giving them at least  six months  notice.  at this point, the only thing that gives me pause is sydney.  i have to make sure she has a home for a few years, and i have to be sure that whoever gets her knows what they're getting into.  sydney's a good cat in a lot of ways... very clean, very well mannered, sweet as all get out... and that tiny meow.  that said, she likes to scratch stuff, and i should probably get that in check before i expose her to furniture that isn't dorm-rated.

      a recruiter called today, and i'm all set up to interview/be fingerprinted next friday afternoon.  the recruiter also wants to flesh out one of my essay responses.  i wasn't altogether happy with my essays.  like i've said before, my capacity for churning out long form answers that are semi-coherent has been damaged by one too many english classes over the years.  more often than not, i come off sounding like a damn moron... or maybe i always sounded that way, and all of those english classes just helped me to recognize my own moronitude.  setback: i called today to register for esl pre-training classes, but it turns out they were completely full for the month.  ok.  august, then.  now i won't be able to sit down and actually tutor anyone until sometime in september.  too many do-gooders in this world, i tell you.  this weekend: friday, i did very little.  saturday, i tried to see the grand excursion, but the boats were late, and it started to rain.  plus, i didn't care.  jer and i hooked up psx controllers to the computer and played some old arcade games via mame.  you know mame, right?  of course you do.  everyone comes back to mame once a year to remember just how bad most of the games were they drooled over years ago.  remember ""narc"" and ""bad dudes""?  terrible, terrible games ( ""i'm bad!"" ).  ""final fight"" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.  ahh, to be back in the k-mart arcade playing ""altered beast"" and ""time warriors""...  sunday, i sat around some more.  while everyone else was watching fireworks, i was sitting through ""fahrenheit 9-11"".  in a nutshell: i loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.  moore's naked contempt for g.w. is palatable when it's merely being insinuated.  it's less so when he refers to g.h.w. bush as g.w.'s ""daddy""... but then i guess that's what political discourse has become in this country.  as with ""bowling for columbine"", moore's film is most effective when read at arm's length.  many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with saudi arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.  wild man dan nordquist has invited me to post on his new  urllink video game blog .  see you there.
