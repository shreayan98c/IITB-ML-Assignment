      with each and every passing day its hard to imagine your going away... i still wake up every day cherishing your presence in a special way... no matter where i am or what i'm doing your always there in my heart... you never leave my mind, or eyes, i don't even try it would be to hard....  each minute away seems like a whole day and a different place.... each hour is spent picturing your smile and your face.... each thought becomes physical, as i race to make it home.... excited to just see your face, not have to talk on the phone....  i realize when i walk through the door i've been dreaming all day.... your more beautiful than i could ever dream now that we're face to face... as i wrap my arms around you and cherish we're in the same place... alls i can think of is your passionate kiss, and how i've longed for its taste....  its time to relax now so we sit down and vent about our days... we talk about all we've done, and how we missed each others face.... we spend our evenings together whoever said they needed space.... we wrap around each other as we drift away to our dreams... i'm laying next to the only girl i want how bad can life be.....  to many this is boring and just seems like killing time.... to me this is heaven and just being with what is mine.... listening to her breathe in my ear, knowing just then shes fine.... we might be lame laying there all curled.... but i wouldn't change a thing, i'm the happiest man in the world....

      so far today has been quite interesting.  i arrived at work to find that one of my loans was ready to be processed and closed, which means lots of money coming my way real quick.  then i got paid for another deal, sally came down to my office and we went to the bank together to deposit the check into our account.  she just now left to work from here and is working the majority of the evening most likely.  i think i'm gonna head home here in a bit, possibly go tanning on the way back... hmmmm ya know fuck it... i think i'm gonna have 'steve time' and go ahead and do that shit.    things have been really ..... stressful lately i'm not sure why but.... in the words of eminem... sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders everyones leaning on me.....  i'm gonna pull through and be victorious though... i mean fuck, i don't have a choice.  i have people that are depending on me... so i have too.    sometimes life just seems like it would be so much easier with out any obligations except for myself, but then i realize that easier is not always better... and sometimes when you have obligations they make you achieve more.... i wouldn't trade my obligations for nothing.  my obligations are human and alive... and i love em both... but fuck... heh....

      dear monday, i hate you. i always have. but i need you, and never have.    it's monday and here we are again, a new week that no one wants to experince.  i'm at work, after tearing myself apart from sally this morning who only wanted me to be there with her and not leave.... she sat by the window as i was leaving and made me feel bad.. it was cute - but then i had to convince her that we need money and i don't make money by watching her put on make up... i wish i did... well who doesn't.  so now i'm at work and i'm still waiting on my mom to get some paper work to me....   this weekend sally and i just chilled, begining with friday night it was an early night - we both fell alsleep rather early ..... she worked all night.  saturday night we got really intoxicated and i really can't recall much of saturday night because that is how drunk we were.  sunday we laid together on the couch and watched a documentary on tupac and biggie, then fell alsleep watching the oscars.  haha anywhoooooo.  last night i decided that i'm going to start a new corporation.  like an online mortgage loan officer.  it is still in the works of being planned and cordinated, but hopefully in the next few weeks i'm able to compile enough resources and information in order to get this put together.  this could only make me more money, by providing a central location where people can go and fill out an online loan application, recieve a user name and password, so that they are able to login at any time and check the status of the pending loan application - additionally any time a change happens with their loan application the system will email them and make the client aware of the changes.   i am learning that advertising is such a complicated, yet simple task.  to advertise you are gambling.  you are putting a lot of assets into the marketing campaign with only hope and faith that there will be a profitable return from it.  *sigh*.  i hope that this works out for me...i guess you guys will be able to come along my journey in starting this and getting it off the ground..... oh yea and if you have any hints or advice.. you can share that too.... peace.

      as i pondered what today had to offer me i realized that i'm not even 100% positive as to what this day they call ""memorial day"" signifies.. so i did some research.  now today is a very very important day for many families in america, who have been unable to smell, speak, hear, touch, their loved ones due to loosing them in a war and as a former soldier myself i suppose that if i were to have ever died in combat that i would want to be remembered on more than one occasion a year (my birthday).  its sad really, as you drive up and down the streets, turn on your radio, this holiday has become more recognized for a ""4 day party"" than its intended meaning.    am i guilty?  of course i'm guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.  as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.  as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club.    i'm lucky, that i'm able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i've lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.  we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started. we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.  cool quote i found:  "" soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er, sleep the sleep that knows not breaking, dream of battled fields no more. days of danger, nights of waking.

      in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn't.  now i'm having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i'm having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i'm living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.    then on top of that i'm having to deal with this new...""rule"".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month ""off of me"" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  in a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be ""her choice"" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can't shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i'm still not feeling ""settled"" with all of it.  something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say ""okay we don't mind this now, you took a month off of him"" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don't know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i'm even more at loss... really... blah i just don't know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we'll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i'm counting...   keep ya updated.  latah.

      today was a pretty simple day.  went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.  well she don't live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.  anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.  we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did alot of laughing.  after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.  its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn't it?  so we smoked - then i drove her home... and got home a little bit ago from that journey.   thats all my day really consisted of, and all it will consist of, because now i'm going to bed - because i'm fucking tired.   here is a picture i took today of capone  and jess  - cute.     awwww capone and i have a  new friend we like to hang out with :)   here is a picture of her and i watching dave chappelles hbo special...      shes good people.   -goodnight

      so i went to see 'fahrenheit 911'. it's very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it. some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary. the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden's and the saudi's is so disturbing that it makes my head ache. some very well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden's family). 2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi's and from the bin-laden family. 3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an 'unofficial' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001. 4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states. 5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes. 6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration. go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you'll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush's)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined. bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden's, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war. there were no wmd's in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq. the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits. that's it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. and it's utterly disgusting.   urllink click here for showtimes and listings.   -goodnight

      second post of the day.... but i just found two cool things i felt the need to share.  as i was sitting bored looking for something to do / or something to read i came across a website that a girl made devoted to her boyfriend.  it sort of reminded me of the old envyme.org - yet this had a rich taste about it.  somewhere on the site i found a simple writing she had wrote about him, and it choked the shit out of me.  so i'm sharing it.    my love. my one true love. i wake up for this everyday. i breathe for this. i'm happy because of him. the smell of his hair. his family. his cats. his sense of humor. his eyes. his sweet attitude. his hands. his ""uh- huh""s and free back rubs. everything about him. i love it all. he completes me & theres nowhere else i'd rather be then in his arms, with the title ""girlfriend"". i'm glad were not arguing.  i'm glad were happy.  i'm glad we have eachother to talk to.  i'm just happy. & it makes me happy to make him happy.    now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i'm going to sit down... and just write how i feel.  amazing.    the second thing   i want to share - i've heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...     don't cry because its over, smile because it happened....    this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i'm happy it happened.  i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn't i learn?  because of my relationship with sally my next relationship is bound to be  fucking amazing  - because of what i learned in this one.

      so after much partying this weekend - i think i got it all out of my system.  this weekend was probably the best weekend i've had since all the drama - only because i didn't really think about it other than recieving a bunch of mail with her name on it - so it just... was an overall smooth weekend.    today is sunday, fathers day.  i'm not going to go over to my parents and celebrate fathers day today though ... i think i'm going to celebrate... ""sonday"" because in reality thats all today really is right?  haha.  anywho so i can't say i'm really 'enjoying' the single life - i miss every bit of my old life... but for the circumstances that i'm faced with i guess i'm making the best of it.  it sucks that sally and i can't even have a simple talk about anything - and neither one of us really know anything about what each other is up to do or doing... so i mean its hard.    i talked to a few girls this weekend which i suppose is progress, but i talked about all the drama which i'm sure was not too impressive... i'm still standing strong on the whole being single thing until june next year.. who knows how that will end up - but fuck at least i got a goal?  i still sit and hope sometimes that when my phone rings its her... and we're going to be able to have a civil conversation and do some catching up.. but those hopes fade away quickly when i see the reality of who is calling.  i wont deny it.  i miss her.    ahhh here is some cool shit - i went to jd's piano bar the other day and they called me up on stage as i was up there having a song sung to me... this girl was right at the stage sitting behind the bar that seperates the stage from the chairs... she was standing up... little cute mexican girl... so i picked her up.. over the bar.. and brought her on stage with me... 10 minutes later... she was gone :(  i thought that was kind of funny.  *sigh* so tonight i'm staying home... gonna do some cleaning up... tomorrow ... work :(.... and then gym... then.. we're having a small get together at our place for like a ... house warming gig... so.. i'm out like a gangstah in the night....  - dont hate  secret note:  hazards 3 times / all the way down the road.

      i guess i should pay my web hosting bill so that i can continue this wonderful, exciting, humanizing journal.  until i do i think i'll still make a quick post.  i never imagined that becoming single would cause my life to become more exciting.  for the last five nights in a row i have been out and have met so many awesome people its.. a bit over whelming.  i wouldn't trade being able to go to different places, and seeing different people, and meeting different people, and forming my own group of friends for anything.  it truely is as if my life is begining to venture out on its own - last night i got my first .... phone call that was like... ""hey come party""... so of course last night i partied.  *sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...   wed night was crazy.  i went to jd's in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.  *sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.  i got home and... passed right out. it was over.  tonight we're going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for uofm party.  *sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i'm meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :)

      tonight was the first night i have actually went out and had a good time without thinking of all of the drama that has been surrounding my life lately.  my buddy mike and i started our night out by going and seeing ""the day after.."" the movie was ... alright.  we followed up the movie by hitting up peppi's sports bar and had a few drinks, he sang a few songs, i rejected a few chicks - and then we continued on with our wonderful night.    i didn't realize until the way home.. that i didn't think about all of this bullshit once tonight.  now that is progress.  let me tell you.  so i'm sitting here drunk and ... fixing to goto bed because it is an early morning i have to go to work and do the responsible thing... ya know?  (some people have to work for what they want / have) and for those that don't ... yes i'm jealous... but at the same time i also have something that you guys lack.. its called pride.  something you will swear you have for the things that are given to you..which you probably do have a bit of pride in the things that are handed too you - 5 years down the line compare your feeling now to the feeling you will have when you get something on your own ;).  yes that was a stab at some people.  anywho...  so last night mike and i went to a get together @ his frat buddies house - watched the pistons game which was just unfuckingbelievable... shortly after the pistons game we decided that we were in the mood to celebrate so we went to tonic and got drunk! drank, danced... chatted a bit... it was an overall pretty good fucking night.  okay.. so .. i'm out like the drunk guy i am... work in the morning. :(   -goodnight :)

""have fun tonight"".  the only down fall to all of this is that i'm having to go with someone that dont like bars (my brother)... so its probably not going to be all that fun but fuck.. who knows...  1 year no sex, no girls.  thats my plan.  anyways so thats my post about today... life almost started to feel like it was kicking me in the ribs again... i had to look in the mirror and tell myself i'm sick of it.  *gets back up with confidence*   -goodnight

      today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.  a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels ""right"".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.    in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the cvs to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, ""i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you"".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i'm not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i've been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i'm not in her life - which i'm sure doesn't take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.    as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i'm living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i ""lived in michigan"" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.    this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn't do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i'm not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i'm going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we're able to survive this.  *sigh*

      i think the poem actually speaks for itself - so there is nothing i can really add.  except, comment of course.   windows are down as the cool breeze goes by the music is on low so i can hear myself drive  i watch the lines in the road as they go by slow i hear the raine hitting my tires as if it were snow  i can smell the humidity flowing in the air my face is getting wet and i just dont care  every few seconds i watch my windshield get wiped its just at that moment i realize how alone i am tonight  i pull over in a empty lot with really bright lights i get my pen and pad cease the moment and start to write  i begin to observe all which i can see i begin to realize no one else is around but me  i ask myself questions hoping my heart will be honest i ask myself if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex's  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even look behind  life is music and you just have to learn how to dance i think i've learned enough now, i'll give love another chance  here i am sitting alone in this lot with not a bit of fear if i could be anywhere else in the world i'd still be right here.

if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex's  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even

      its 5:30 pm and the invites to places have already began to pour in for tonight. yet i'm still so fucking clueless as to what i'm going to do - what should i do?  this is the question i'm left pondering.  although i'm totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i'm also really not in the mood to be in the ""club"" atmosphere.  i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.  1) canada with like 12 people 2) saginaw street 3) i'm making this one up right now - the movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?  everyone already seems to have plans.. i don't have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.  maybe it'll end up just a 'steve night' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.  now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.  i think i'm gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, but who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.  okay i'm going to eat a bologna sandwich.    peace.

""the story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many americans. but you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of congress.  because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. well, i'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in washington, d.c.  and when i'm president, america will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected â– it is a right for all americans.""    very cool john:  ""i want to address these next words directly to president george w. bush: in the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. let's build unity in the american family, not angry division. let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in american history, the constitution of the united states.""    these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i'm looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.    maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?  something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.  for a full transcript of johns speech  urllink click here .  2008 i'll be part of this:    -goodnight.

      so have you guys been paying any attention to the democratic national convention?  i'm sure you've seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i'm not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.  i'm going to simply post an over view of trends i'm noticing.  one thing interesting about this election, is that ""blogging"" is actually becoming a voice on the web.  at this years dnc there is a whole slew of ""bloggers"" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.  that is amazing.  here is a picture of them setup at the convention.  this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.  this is moving.    although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.  so i've added some links to the right hand side, that i'm reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the dnc, that we don't see come through the tube.  also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about "" urllink blogging from boston "".    so is everyone excited for a new president?  prepare. :)

      they say you can not help how you feel, and i'm here to testify that this is the truth.  its impossible.  if it were divorce rates would be on a stead decline by now.  on that note - i am not superman, i'm human.  i bleed, i suffer, i breathe, i feel.  you all know who i'm talking about in this poem, but try to look past that and focus  what  i'm talking about in this writing.  i think the majority of you guys will enjoy it.. i'll turn on comments for it.  let me know your thoughts, and as long as they are constructive i'll continue to let you know mine.    the smell of your skin is still tainted in my mind the warmth of your body at night knowing you were still mine  passion in our actions as we kissed away our days the sleepless nights that i would lay awake and pray  your hand upon my leg as we drive into the stars beyond the physical touch your passion went so far  chasing you to the room just to throw you down sitting on top of you staring not making a sound  eyes talking as if they were mouths emotions so pure they pour right out  as we would bath together i could smell your hair taking it for granted now i just think of you there  it is all the small things that i have grown to miss its the simple taken for granted things like a small kiss  feet cold enough to freeze the sun and cause a storm yet everynight i knew it was my job to keep them warm  no insecurities or doubts in my head just knowing you cared enough to look ahead  the dependence you put on me to become a man the dependence i had in you for you to hold my hand  i miss the romance and passion and comfort of love i miss the small things all the way down to a hug  i miss everything in life being more because it was you i miss the goodnights and the i love yous because i know they were true  so these are my secrets that my heart can not hide these are the feelings that im left dealing with inside  is there a cure for all of these deep thoughts will i ever find this again or are they lost.    answer to email: the title ""message in a bottle"" is perfect for this poem.  i wrote it and threw it in the ocean.. now we are going to see who reads it. thanks for the note though :)

      i've needed to get away for a minute, and just have not had the oppertunity with work and everything.  so this weekend i ended up going 4 1/2 hours north west to the other side of michigan to go camping for a day with my family.  i was apprehensive at first only because, i generally don't like hanging out with my family - but it ended up being a blast, the family got along great - everyone was laughing, in fact i had such an amazing time that when it came time to leave there tonight - i hesitated cause i was having so much fun. wierd eh?  so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.  none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was wrong!)  so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!! what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won't actually tell you anything... but you'll be able to tell from the pictures what i'm talking about.  i watched my second sunset in my entire life!! (check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was in another world wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...   i didn't even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...   we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family. then i realized lyndsey wasn't there, but it still felt good. i miss her.  anyways it was odd.  i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went right back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.  would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i'll make it easy here is a link   urllink click on sand dunes   sooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.  so... goodnight... and farewell!!  comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes.

      well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :p .  apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can't be mad at that kel :p  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i'm not sure what is going on with my dad.  after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.  i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.  ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.  it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.  this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.  it was gangster.  anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool.    left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.  it was.. disgusting really.  at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.  as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his cd was one of the better cd's to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said ""listen to this..."" and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned cd straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.  he ended the conversation by saying, ""alright man i have to get up there.."" (v.i.p) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i'm home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i'm watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i'm out like a thief in the night :)  -night. ps. let me know what you guys think of the new look. :)

      why am i up?  its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.  nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.  why am i still up?  who the fuck knows.  the more i think about it, the more i fear i'll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.  by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.  to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty's band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.  the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.  it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.  came home, posted real quick, and crashed.  today was fun. mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.  so regardless we got our workout on.  we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.  the minute i got home i showered because i was extremely hot.  that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.  so now i'm up and i can't sleep.  but now i've posted, so maybe i'm relaxed enough to try again.  alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.  ps.  i couldn't be happier with life right now :)

      ok, can i just talk about gw bush the 'good ole boy'?  i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover. and yale. he's from greenwich, connecticut.  he vacations in maine.  and don't get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.  but they're not exactly breeding grounds for 'good ole boys' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).  it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he's a man of the people.  gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that's it.  so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.  if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i'm a weight-lifter from siberia.   just seen him on the news and got annoyed.   -goodnight

      for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.  this is normal, as i'm sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.  it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i'm sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.  which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i'd get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it.    so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?   there were a few 'firsts' for everything today.  when i woke up the first thing i did was look for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.  so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.  i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.  the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn't a sign.  anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.  i remember what the '5 a.m.' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.  sorry i didn't pick up.  none the less...   there is nothing else to post.  -goodnight

      ""honesty"" it is something that i'm learning.  for in the past i would have been 'afraid' of sarah's reaction to ""the truth"" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.  do i regret telling her the truth? not at all.  you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.  yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren't ending for any ""odd"" reason for which she couldn't understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.  i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.  i think that was just considered, 'rambling' was it not?    anyways.  so today was pretty lame. (as i'm typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).  i stayed home most of the day... oh wait.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.     so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly's apartment and watched ""ghost ship"" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things.    i'm feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the 'cloud' that over shadowed sarah and i's friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, ""what cloud?"" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn't ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.   i'm going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.   -goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!

      last night i went to lush barroom again.  that was kind of cool.  afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club. left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am. fun? no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn't end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked.    today i'm going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the 'techofest' which should be a blast, i'm excited for it anyways.  we'll see how that goes.  bye.   does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i'm still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i'm hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies? or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?  it is for me.

      today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the 'village square' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the a/c.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the 'training' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah's house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick's house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i'm beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i'm slowing down time.. or i'm speeding up with it, and i'm beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i'm rambling).  what i'm really trying to say is... i'm becoming more focused ... i'm becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah's house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i've had to deal with, but i wasn't as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i've become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble ""myself"" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i'm becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i've become more wise.. and since you can't learn wisdom, and you can't teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i'm growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.    -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page.

      well lets see. last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.  actually i'm kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.  with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.  ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.     update:   today i totally relaxed. it was wonderful.  at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she ""knew"".  yes that was wonderful.  that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn't have enjoyed today more.    tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...   - peace & goodnight

      this post will not be long tonight i don't think, but then again who the fuck knows.  my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.  which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.  i don't get it.  anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.  sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.  sue me.  it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.  i've written 3 lines and just erased them.    today was interesting.  i got the job i've wanted forever.  yes, caught you off guard did it not?  i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of 'doubt' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i'm fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i'm going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject.    after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn't the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i'll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn't even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the ""random"" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i'm not going to tell you how.   i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i'd feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn't kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i'd be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.   that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don't think you'll find a negetive one so i think i'm entitled to being 'down' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.   -goodnight

      today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed ""alone time"" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn't trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i'm totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven't checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.    clownsteve: you get the pics downloaded? kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i'll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i'm in for the night.   -latah

      before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   ""can you imagine if peter parker was high?""    ""steve this thing is so long and big""  (burrito at taco bell)   ""is this the cd?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio.""  (eminem - stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some ""goods"" we went and smoked, in kelly's apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it'd be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can't write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don't think i've laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i'm home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn't let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.   haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn't end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn't change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.    so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.  (should have pictures of tonight tomorrow)
