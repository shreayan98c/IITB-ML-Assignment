      ok this is quite old but supposedly people have  urllink the real dirt on appleâ€™s cinema displays?   while the sizes seem about right as well as the resolutions there are a couple of things that common sense just state don't work.  first of all, switching from the adc(apple display connector) to dvi.  i think apple really likes be slick and having as few wires as possible.  with dropping adc you lose video, power and usb all in one cable.  so you would go from 1 cable to 3 cables.  which brings me to my next point, they state there will be 2 firewire ports on it.  how is this possible since adc doesn't carry firewire signal and if they do go with dvi there would be neither usb or firewire.  so now that's 4 wires coming out of this display.  bleh i wouldn't mind many of these features but just don't see it happening.
