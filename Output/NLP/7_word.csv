      until genkai 1 is done! 
 
 thanks to shari's deft handling of getting the genkai 1 alliance going&nbsp;on friday/saturday, our genkai experience was only mildly horrible instead of as excruciatingly horrible as it could have been.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 on friday, starting out with an alliance of 10 people that would eventually grow to 12 and then shrink back to five as the night went on, we managed to obtain 7/8 of the needed exoray molds in a mere 5 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;during this time we&nbsp; somehow  (read: i blame everything on dynastey) &nbsp;managed to aggro nearly everything in the nest at least once,&nbsp;and in the case of water&nbsp;elementals&nbsp;- two or three times. 
 
 saturday turned out better.&nbsp;on our trek to eldeime dyn only managed to aggro half of the mobs in the glacier -- a personal best!&nbsp; even with a smaller group than the night before, we were still able to dispatch anything that came our way.&nbsp; in a mere four hours we were rewarded with 4/8 papyrus and only one death and level down.&nbsp; it was just shari, so it wasn't so bad. :) 
 
 the next outing for genkai items will probably be posted here, hopefully by shari.&nbsp; if not, check our  urllink newly created forums &nbsp;for more information.&nbsp; arrr! p)

      no xp fun was to be had last night as shorty the whm was mia.&nbsp; the rest of the swashbucklers enjoyed individual pursuits that were generally successul.
 
    sharkky  ran around the jungles of yhoator trying to find a specific tree.&nbsp; no word of whether or not he actually found his tree.&nbsp; search parties have been dispatched.   dynastey  spent his time fishing until he realized that the moon was not in his favor, and then tried his luck at cooking dog food.&nbsp; your dog will need some tums.   shari  went off to level his lvl 6 thf.&nbsp; armed with a stack of mithkabobs and a toothpick, our intrepid taru braved the wilds of sarutabaruta and just might have realized the wonders of farming.&nbsp; could this be true?&nbsp; the count on the ""shari beg-o-meter"" has been reset. ^^;   skellington  ran around the maze of shakrami in search of a new place to farm, and instead found many lowbies who died horrible deaths at the hands of linking bats.&nbsp; stonega should require a license to operate.   tomorrow, genkai madness!

      gang, we will return you to our regularly scheduled program of xping!  every night but tues and thurs this week at 10 in jeuno!
 
 one exception is we might have to do a makeup genkai run.  this would pre-empt the xping on one of said nights.
